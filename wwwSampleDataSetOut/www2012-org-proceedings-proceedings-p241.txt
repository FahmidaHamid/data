ABSTRACT
One of the most popular user activities on the Web is watch-
ing videos. Services like YouTube, Vimeo, and Hulu host
and stream millions of videos, providing content that is on
par with TV [21]. While some of this content is popular
all over the globe, some videos might be only watched in a
conﬁned, local region.

In this work we study the relationship between popular-
ity and locality of online YouTube videos. We investigate
whether YouTube videos exhibit geographic locality of in-
terest, with views arising from a conﬁned spatial area rather
than from a global one. Our analysis is done on a corpus of
more than 20 millions YouTube videos, uploaded over one
year from diﬀerent regions. We ﬁnd that about 50% of the
videos have more than 70% of their views in a single region.
By relating locality to viralness we show that social sharing
generally widens the geographic reach of a video. If, how-
ever, a video cannot carry its social impulse over to other
means of discovery, it gets stuck in a more conﬁned geo-
graphic region. Finally, we analyze how the geographic prop-
erties of a video’s views evolve on a daily basis during its life-
time, providing new insights on how the geographic reach of
a video changes as its popularity peaks and then fades away.
Our results demonstrate how, despite the global nature of
the Web, online video consumption appears constrained by
geographic locality of interest: this has a potential impact
on a wide range of systems and applications, spanning from
delivery networks to recommendation and discovery engines,
providing new directions for future research.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, most of the media content was distributed via
media organizations that often segmented users in regional
markets, releasing new content in a controlled way. Hence,
video popularity was seldom a global phenomenon, as users
could not access the same content all over the world. With
the advent of online video sharing platforms like YouTube
such regional barriers were largely demolished, making most
content items accessible from all over the globe.

With more than 3 billion videos viewed everyday and hav-
ing more than 70% of its traﬃc coming from outside the US
[20] YouTube is an ideal data source to authoritatively an-
swer the question whether, despite global availability, most
videos enjoy only local popularity and, if yes, how.

To understand the rules that govern the geographic reach
of a video, it is important to ﬁrst understand the general ac-
cess pattern of YouTube videos. It was shown by Cha et al.
[5] that video popularity on YouTube exhibits a “long-tail”
behavior: some videos are able to accumulate hundreds of
millions of views, whereas the vast majority can only attract
a few. This unbalanced skew of video popularity can be ex-
ploited to serve the huge interest for a potentially unlimited
number of relatively unpopular items [1]: users are able to
discover and enjoy millions of videos about niche topics they
are interested in, even though each individual video might
not accrue a large number of overall views. How video pop-
ularity relates to the global reach of a video, and whether
unpopular videos still enjoy high popularity in a certain ge-
ographic area is an open question we will address in this
paper.

Geographic locality of interest.

Several factors may give rise to geographic locality of in-
terest in online videos. For instance, topics like sports, poli-
tics, and news, tend to have a spatial focus of interest [8, 2],
and thus geographic relevance is a powerful factor impact-
ing video popularity. Another factor is geographic proximity
between users, since web content tends to spread through
word-of-mouth across social connection [15]. Since users
close to each other tend to exhibit similarities in language
and culture [13, 3], spatial closeness may also constrain the
propagation of video web links over online social network-
ing platforms: as recently studied, a large fraction of such
cascading steps happen at relatively short-range spatial dis-
tances [16, 15]. Consequently, the geographic scope of a
video might well be constrained to web users in a limited
geographic region, with important consequences to how rel-
evant it might be to users in that region [8].

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 241Besides its impact on users, geographic locality of inter-
est has also an impact on systems and infrastructures. In
fact, skewed popularity of content items positively impacts
caching mechanisms, which are able to serve a large fraction
of requests by storing only a handful of the most popular
items [18]. When popularity is geographically scoped, dis-
tributed caching mechanisms can be devised to optimize per-
formance: spatial locality of interest potentially represents a
great advantage for modern geographically distributed con-
tent delivery networks and data centers. These large-scale
infrastructures distribute their content from storage servers
replicated across multiple locations over the planet, aiming
to maximize the overall eﬃciency [12]. Whenever items ap-
pear predominantly requested from a given geographic area
it becomes possible to devise mechanisms that improve de-
livery performance: by exploiting the simple fact that fu-
ture requests of a given item are more likely to be gener-
ated at a close geographic distance from the previous ac-
cesses, spatially distributed caching servers can achieve high
hit ratios[19, 16]. These aspects become even more im-
portant when considering how both social mechanisms and
geographic location aﬀect how content is consumed on the
Web[16, 14].

Finally, online video streaming is forecasted to account for
50% of consumer Internet traﬃc by 2012 [6]. Since YouTube
constitutes one of the largest sources of this traﬃc, under-
standing how and where users watch YouTube videos be-
comes of paramount importance and provides insights use-
ful across several domains, ranging from building predictive
models of user interest to designing recommending systems.

Our approach.

The question we address in this work is whether a geo-

graphic locality of interest is eﬀectively experienced by YouTube
videos and, if so, how to measure and understand it. In par-
ticular, we aim to answer these research questions:

• do YouTube videos experience geographic locality of
interest or, rather, a uniform view popularity across
the world?

• how are social and geographic factors inﬂuencing the

spatial properties of YouTube video traﬃc?

• do YouTube videos experience a uniform geographic
interest over their lifetime or, instead, do they exhibit
distinctive patterns in their temporal evolution?

In order to illustrate these issues and try to answer these
questions, our approach focuses on directly studying how
YouTube videos enjoy views from diﬀerent parts of the world
over their lifetime. In addition, we study how these views
might be generated by social rather than non-social mecha-
nisms and how other characteristics such as the type of video
content and the main geographic area of interest aﬀect the
geographic provenance of video views. We analyze a large
corpus of YouTube videos: since each single viewing event
can be assigned to a geographic region, we are able to deﬁne
concepts such as the focus location of a video, its view focus
and its view entropy, a measure of the dispersion of its audi-
ence. By adopting these quantitative concepts we are able to
track and compare how a video exhibits diﬀerent geographic
patterns of interest and to numerically assess the impact of
other properties on its geographic audience (Section 2).

Our contributions.

With our analysis we uncover some surprising facts about
the geographic properties of YouTube video popularity, while
at the same time we are able to conﬁrm how YouTube videos
enjoy a strong geographic locality of interest:

• YouTube videos are local: we ﬁnd that about 50%
of videos have more than 70% of their total views in
a single country (which holds even for popular videos)
(Section 3);

• Viral spreading traps videos: we analyze that the
impact of social sharing on the geographic properties
of video views is surprisingly non-trivial. As a video
receives a larger fraction of views through social mech-
anisms its geographic audience widens, but when the
fraction of socially-generated views grows larger than
20% the videos experience a more focused popularity
in fewer regions (Section 4);

• Popularity expands and withdraws back: we dis-
cuss that video popularity evolves over time, exhibiting
a peak of interest which then fades away, video views
immediately grow in the focus location and only then
they expand across other regions, withdrawing back to
the focus location after the peak (Section 5).

2. METHODOLOGY

In this work we study a corpus of more than 20 million
YouTube videos randomly selected from the set of all videos
uploaded to YouTube between September 2010 and August
2011. Adopting a year-long sampling period allows us to
avoid the average seasonalities exhibited by user behavior
over the year, albeit YouTube traﬃc was steadily increasing
over this period.

2.1 Data description

We have access to the number of daily views coming from
diﬀerent geographic regions for each video: these regions
represent national countries or other political and geographic
entities. Overall, there are about 250 diﬀerent such re-
gions, including oﬃcial states and minor territories. The
data available for each video include the video category and
the breakdown of views by referrer, that is, by the website
the user arrived from. We classify these referrer sources as

only in the cases when the user directly typed the URL into
the browser, viewed the video embedded in a third-party
website or clicked on a link on an external website. All the
other sources, mainly related to web search or YouTube in-
ternal navigation, are considered non-social.

2.3 Basic properties

The set of videos under analysis encompasses a wide range
of popularity levels, from videos with a handful of views to
videos with millions of hits. The probability distribution
of lifetime video views Vi, depicted in Figure 1, exhibits a

the top k regions as a function of the region rank

traﬃc. For a given video, the top 10 regions mount
up to, on average, more than 80% of the total num-
ber of views.

typical heavy-tail behavior, with a few, extremely popular
videos accruing the main numbers of requests. At the same
time, the vast majority of videos has only few views: 50%
of YouTube videos have less than 50 views over the period
under analysis.

Analyzing how YouTube views are distributed across the
world conﬁrms that the majority of YouTube traﬃc does not
come from the USA [20]: as shown in Figure 2(a), only 26%
of YouTube views are generated in the USA, with other re-
gions generating at maximum about 5% of views each. More
in detail, the global distribution in Figure 2(b) shows how
regions exhibit an approximately exponentially decreasing
fraction of views when they are ranked. This is largely due
to the fact that many of these regions are fairly small and/or
have a comparatively small Internet population. Thus, the
views received by YouTube videos are likely to concentrate
in a handful of key regions which contain a large amount of
the world population of web users.

However, this concentration eﬀect for individual videos
is much stronger than the global distribution suggests. In
fact, on average YouTube videos acquire a large fraction of
their views from only a very small number of regions: as
displayed in Figure 3, whereas the top 10 countries gener-
ate only about 60% of YouTube global views, for individual
videos the average value is higher than 80%. Hence, single
videos seem to enjoy a vast share of their popularity in a
few, key countries, exhibiting a highly localized interest.

2.4 Locality measures

In order to quantitatively study whether a YouTube video
receives views from a global rather than from a local audi-
ence we exploit the segmentation of views across diﬀerent
regions: our aim is to deﬁne some measures to understand
whether videos exhibit locality of interest eﬀects, allowing
us to investigate the potential causes of such behavior. The
main idea behind these measures is that a video enjoying
a highly localized popularity would likely exhibit a non-
uniform distribution of its views across diﬀerent regions,
with a large fraction of them in only a few regions. On
the other hand, videos with a global pattern of popularity
are likely to have more uniform distribution of their views
across the regions.

Previous attempts to deﬁne the geographic scope of web
resources have focused on measuring the peak intensity and
the uniformity of the interest that such resources trigger
over a set of geographically-deﬁned regions [8]. We adopt
a similar methodology, deﬁning two key measures for each
YouTube video: the view focus and the view entropy.

The view focus Fi of video i is deﬁned as

Fi =

1
Vi

max

k

vik

(1)

The view focus is the highest fraction of views that video i
has received in a single region over its entire lifetime. As a
consequence, we deﬁne Li as the focus location of video i,
that is, the region where video i has its view focus, randomly
breaking ties between regions. In a similar way, we deﬁne
the daily view focus F t
i considering only the daily views of
video i on day t.

The view entropy Hi of video i is deﬁned as

Hi = − M(cid:88)

k=1

vik
Vi

log2

vik
Vi

where the sum is running only over regions for which vik (cid:54)= 0.
As its name suggests, the view entropy is eﬀectively the in-
formation entropy of the distribution of views of video i over
the diﬀerent regions. Hence, higher values of view entropy
denote videos whose views are spread more uniformly across
several regions, while lower entropy values signal video views
more focused in less regions.
In the rest of this paper,
we always express numerical values of view entropy in bits.
Again, we deﬁne the daily view entropy H t
i considering only
the daily views of video i on day t.

3. LOCALITY OF INTEREST

We start our analysis by studying the locality measures
previously deﬁned, discussing the overall predominance of
locality of interest in YouTube videos. Then, we investigate
how videos belonging to diﬀerent categories, and popular
in diﬀerent regions, present diverse patterns of geographic
popularity.
3.1 Measuring locality of interest

It is worth highlighting that if every single video experi-
enced a distribution of views across diﬀerent regions as the
distribution of global YouTube traﬃc, depicted in Figure 2,
then on average videos would exhibit a view focus of about
0.26 (that is the fraction of views coming from the USA) and
a view entropy of about 5 bits. Instead, individual videos
exhibit not only a wide range of values of these metrics, but

also values that signal a more localized interest from users
in a small subset of regions.

The distribution of view focus in Figure 4(a) shows hows
videos exhibit the whole range of values, with the median
value close to 0.7.
In particular, there are about 40% of
YouTube videos that enjoy at least 80% of their views in
a single region. This is already strong evidence supporting
the claim that videos tend to become popular in a locally
conﬁned area, rather than in a globally wide region. Fur-
thermore, as videos accumulate more views, they tend to
be watched in a more disparate set of regions: as shown in
Figure 4(b), the average view focus decreases linearly as the
order of magnitude of the number of views grows. Nonethe-
less, even videos with more than 1,000 views, which may
be deemed already fairly popular, exhibit a steady value of
about 0.4. This is still higher than one would expect by
observing the distribution of global YouTube traﬃc in Fig-
ure 2:
in fact, no region exhibits more than 26% of the
overall number of views.

A related trend can be observed when considering the
view entropy, which captures how video views are uniformly
spread over diﬀerent regions. Again, videos have values
much lower than the entropy of the global view distribution:
as seen in the distribution in Figure 5(a), videos have a me-
dian view entropy of 1.5 bits, with about 40% of them with
view entropy lower than 1 bit. On the contrary, view entropy
grows with the number of views: as the order of magnitude
of the number of views grows, view entropy grows linearly.
However, for videos with more than 1,000 views this growth
is much slower: view entropy values reach a plateau at about
3.5 bits.

It is important to consider that only 3% of videos in our
sample have only 1 view, which directly results into a max-
imum view focus of 1.0 and a minimum view entropy of 0.
Nonetheless, there is a signiﬁcant fraction of videos, about
18% of them, that show such extreme locality of interest
when considering both view focus and view entropy.
3.2 Impact of video category

Since YouTube videos cover several diﬀerent topics, which
might have a more global or local geographic appeal, it ap-
pears natural to study the locality of interest exhibited by
diﬀerent video categories. We report the average view focus
and the average view entropy to each category in Table 1.

All the categories have a similar median number of views.
However, their locality metrics span a wide range. In partic-
ular, the categories ”Category 13”, ”Category 14” and ”Cat-
egory 4” enjoy the highest levels of view entropy and the
lowest levels of view focus, denoting an average global ap-

peal of those videos. On the other hand, videos belonging
to the ”Category 5” category display the most local mea-
sures, showing that these videos are more likely to have a
geographically limited audience because of language and cul-
tural constraints. The correlation between view focus and
view entropy for diﬀerent categories is depicted in Figure 6:
high values of view entropy tend to correlate with lower val-
ues of view focus. This conﬁrms how the topic of a video
is strongly aﬀecting how users from a wide geographic area,
rather than a more focused one, are interested in it.
3.3 Impact of video location

Another important aspect which might be aﬀecting the
spatial properties of a video’s views is the location a video
is related to. It is not hard to imagine how items related to
some regions are more accessible by users elsewhere, because
of similar language, culture or interests. Even though it is
often diﬃcult to assign a video to a certain region, a reason-
able and unambiguous proxy is to adopt the focus location
of a video as the region that video is related to and study
the properties of videos that have the same focus location,
comparing them across diﬀerent regions.

As a result, in Table 2 we present the top 10 regions by
number of videos, together with their median number of
views, their average view focus and their average view en-

tropy. More than one third of all videos have their focus
location in the USA, while other countries have less than
5% of videos, with the exception of Brazil. This reﬂects
the overall predominance of YouTube traﬃc generated in
the USA, already observed in Section 2. More interestingly,
some countries such as Brazil and Japan exhibit high val-
ues of view focus: on average, videos whose focus location is
Japan or Brazil have, respectively, 90% or 85% of their views
in their focus location. These values denote a highly local
interest for videos related to those regions, as supported also
by the low values of view entropy in these same regions.

On the other hand, places such as the UK, Mexico and
Canada exhibit more global spatial measures, with lower
view focus and higher view entropy. A potential explana-
tion for these values is that such regions might enjoy traﬃc
coming from the USA, since there is a likely vast interest
overlap among users across these places. Overall, the lo-
cation a video is related to is strongly aﬀecting where its
views are coming from, with some regions much more likely
to exhibit highly local content and others more likely to have
content with a wider geographic appeal. Again, the overall
interest, measured by the number of views received by videos
in diﬀerent regions, does not seem to aﬀect the spatial prop-
erties of video views. Instead, there is a strong correlation
between lower values of view entropy and higher values of
view focus: as shown in the scatter plot of Figure 7, this
relationship seems to hold across all the regions considered
in our analysis.

4. SOCIAL FACTORS

Among the factors driving the success of YouTube there
is the social diﬀusion of individual videos from person to
person across online and oﬄine media. Given the sheer
amount of available videos, it is often diﬃcult for users to
ﬁnd and discover interesting content: thus, relying on sug-
gestions coming from friends is a popular and eﬀective way
to choose what to watch. At the same time, some videos
enjoy a viral spreading thanks to social cascading, resulting
in high levels of overall popularity [4, 9].

In this section our goal is to understand whether social
sharing is aﬀecting not only video popularity, but also the
geographic properties of video popularity. More in detail,
since social interaction among web users appears aﬀected
by geographic distance between them, with individuals more
likely to interact with closer users than with users further
away [3, 17], our question is whether higher levels of social
sharing experienced by YouTube videos result in a more local
geographic pattern of popularity.
4.1 Social ratio

As discussed in Section 2, we can classify each view event
as social or non-social by considering how the user arrived at
the video player, deﬁning the lifetime social ratio of a video
as the fraction of lifetime views coming from social sources.
The distribution of the lifetime social ratio Si, presented in
Figure 8, highlights how YouTube videos enjoy a wide range
of levels of social sharing, with an average value of social
ratio of about 0.37.

However, the amount of social sharing experienced by
YouTube videos is diﬀerent for videos with diﬀerent number
of lifetime views. As shown in Figure 9, the lifetime social
ratio increases with the number of views for videos with less
than 50 views, while it then decreases steadily for videos
with more views. It appears that the impact of social shar-
ing is higher for videos with few views, while when videos
enjoy higher popularity levels then social sharing becomes
less prominent.
4.2 Impact of social sharing

Since the amount of social sharing that a video enjoys is
related to its overall popularity, our aim is to investigate
the impact of social sharing on the geographic popularity.
In detail, our aim is to understand whether higher levels of
social sharing results in a more local, or global, video geo-
graphic popularity. To our surprise, this eﬀect is not simply
linear: videos with a lifetime social ratio close to 0.2, thus

Figure 10: Average view focus (a) and average view
entropy (b) as a function of the lifetime social ratio.

with about 1 out of 5 views generated by social mechanisms,
exhibit more global popularity than other videos.

In fact, as displayed in Figure 10(a), the average view fo-
cus decreases as the social ratio increases from 0 to 0.2, while
then the view focus goes up again for higher levels of social
sharing. This peculiar behavior might be due to the fact
that a low level of social sharing helps the video spreading
across several regions. Instead, when social views are pre-
dominant, it is more likely that social diﬀusion, constrained
by geographic distance, happens within the boundaries of
a single geographic region. A similar trend is observed for
the view entropy in Figure 10(b): as the level of social ra-
tio approaches 0.2 the view entropy is higher, denoting a
widespread attention received by the video from diﬀerent
geographic regions. Higher levels of social sharing, as well
as lower levels, reduce the geographic audience of the video.
However, videos that enjoy diﬀerent levels of overall popu-
larity might exhibit diﬀerent behavior than the overall trend,

which is clearly dominated by the vast majority of videos
that have only a handful of views. In order to understand
the impact of social sharing for videos with higher number of
views we segment all videos into 3 sets: videos with less than
1,000 lifetime views, videos with a number of lifetime views
between 1,000 and 10,000 and videos with more than 10,000
lifetime views. The eﬀect of social sharing for these three
groups of videos is relatively diﬀerent across these three cat-
egories: as displayed in Figure 11, whereas videos with less
than 1,000 views have an average view entropy which still
follows the overall trend of Figure 10(b), with a maximum
value for values of social ratio of about 0.2, more popular
videos with 1,000 to 10,000 views have a similar pattern but
with higher values and then videos with more than 10,000
views exhibit less dependency on the amount of social shar-
ing, with an average view entropy uncorrelated to the social
ratio.

5. TEMPORAL EVOLUTION

After discussing how video properties and social sharing
aﬀect spatial popularity, we shift our attention to the tem-
poral evolution of the geographic patterns of video views.
More in detail, we are interested in studying whether videos
exhibit a steady and uniform level of locality of interest
across their lifetime or if, instead, their geographic audience
changes over time. Finally, we will discuss the relationship
between the amount of social sharing enjoyed by a video and
the temporal evolution of its geographic audience.

Hence, in this section we take advantage of the daily tem-
poral granularity of video views to study how the number of
views, and the related view focus and view entropy, evolve
over time. Videos with an extremely low number of views
do not provide enough data to study their temporal evolu-
tion: thus, all results in this section consider only videos
that receive at least 100 views within their ﬁrst 30 days of
viewing.
5.1 Video Views Growth

In order to aggregate and study videos that in reality are
uploaded and watched during diﬀerent temporal periods, we
align their viewing history in time. We exploit the fact that
videos often experience a peak in their number of views when
they are featured on popular websites or when they become
viral and spread on online social networks. It has also been
suggested that the peculiar way in which the burst of views

Figure 13: Average normalized number of daily
views for videos peaking on diﬀerent days of their
lifetime. Only videos with more than 100 views in
their ﬁrst 30 days are considered.

evolves over time can be exploited to classify the popularity
of a given video [7]. Hence, we choose the day when their
daily views peak as day 0, following a methodology already
successfully adopted for similar purposes [4].

As presented in Figure 12, the videos in our sample are
more likely to peak on their ﬁrst viewing day, with about
38% of them doing so. The number of videos that peak
on successive days is increasingly smaller, with only 22% of
videos peaking on day 2 and 5% on day 3. Even though
videos do peak on diﬀerent days of their lifetime, once their
daily views are aligned there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
their temporal evolution: after the peak the number of daily
views falls back to about 20%-10% of the peak value, regard-
less of the peaking day.

While this pattern may be completely diﬀerent for indi-
vidual videos, especially in the cases where they are promi-
nently featured and promoted, the overall trend appears ro-
bust. Nonetheless, other studies have discussed how the
peculiar pattern exhibited by the time series of daily views,
particularly before and after the peak, can be used to clas-
sify popular videos [7]. This would suggest that our overall
temporal pattern is due to the fact that our much larger
dataset does not focus only on popular videos, but on a
larger representative sample of YouTube videos. Thus, in-
dividual time series of hugely popular videos, which might
show the diﬀerent temporal patterns observed in other in-
vestigations, do not represent the temporal evolution most
commonly experienced by YouTube videos.

age daily view entropy (b) across diﬀerent days of a
video lifetime for three video segments with diﬀer-
ent fraction of social views. Only videos with more
than 100 views in their ﬁrst 30 days are considered.

5.2 Evolution of local interest

As the number of daily views peaks and then falls down,
the spatial properties of these views are likely to change
as well. As we have already discussed in Section 3, videos
with more lifetime views exhibit a wider spatial audience,
with higher values of view entropy and lower values of view
focus. Thus, our aim is to understand whether videos show
a similar behavior when their daily number of views peaks.
To our surprise, we ﬁnd that while the daily view entropy
increases when the number of daily views peaks, the daily
view focus increases as well, as shown in Figure 14. Even
when videos peak on diﬀerent days of their lifetime they
tend to exhibit this pattern, the only diﬀerence being that
videos peaking on later days tend to have a higher daily
view entropy on the peak day. More interestingly, while
daily view entropy slowly decreases after the peak day, the
daily view focus has a sudden drop in the following days
after the peak and then it steadily increases again over the
next days.

These values suggests a scenario where a video suddenly
experiences a large fraction of views coming from its focus
location, while also receiving additional views coming from
other regions. This has the eﬀect of pushing up both the
view focus and the view entropy.
Immediately after the
peak the fraction of views coming from the focus location
goes down, as interest shifts to other regions. Finally, view
traﬃc shifts back to the focus location, since view entropy
decreases and view focus increases.

This “spray-and-diﬀuse” pattern indicates how, on aver-

age, a video tends to become popular and to peak in its own
focus location, and only then the interest generated moves
to other regions. At the end, as popularity fades away video
views retreat back to the focus location.

5.3 Effect of social sharing

Finally, we analyze the impact of social sharing on the
temporal evolution of the spatial properties. Again we time-
align the viewing history of each video, so that the view peak
is on day 0, and we consider the evolution of the daily view
measures, view focus and view entropy, averaged over all
the videos. However, now we consider the fraction of social
views videos receive during their ﬁrst 30 days and then we
divide them in ten quantiles, thus with approximately the
same number of videos in each group. The ﬁrst quantile
contains videos with a fraction of social views lower than
11.8%, whereas the last quantile has videos with at least
74.3% social views.

In Figure 15(a) we show that the main diﬀerence is how
videos that enjoy higher levels of socially-driven traﬃc tend
to have a higher long-term value of view focus, whereas on
the peak days the diﬀerent classes behave similarly. In the
case of view entropy, depicted in Figure 15(b), even on the
peak day videos with higher fraction of social views have
lower view entropy and, at the same time, the long-term
trends are diﬀerent for diﬀerent segments of videos, with
high “socialness” correlated with lower view entropy.

These patterns suggest that the eﬀect of high levels of
social sharing on the temporal evolution is that on the peak

on several ones. Moreover, the long-term trend after the
peak is directly related to the amount of social sharing, with
more social videos enjoying more locally focused popularity.
Overall, these results conﬁrm our previous analysis of the
impact of social sharing even on the temporal daily metrics
of YouTube videos.

IMPLICATIONS

The main result of this work is that even though web
video services address a global audience, much diﬀerently
than how standard media distribution platforms segmented
the world in regional markets, yet online videos experience
patterns of popularity that appear strongly constrained by
geographic locality of interest, with user interest predomi-
nantly coming from few key regions for a vast majority of
items. We believe that even though our analysis has focused
only on YouTube, its wide popularity and its massive user
base allow us to gain insight not only on user behavior on
YouTube itself, but on potential user behavior on other sim-
ilar online media platforms. Furthermore, we see a great
potential to exploit the geographic properties of video pop-
ularity on online services.

An important application of our ﬁndings is in personal-
ization: tailoring video content presented to users according
to their geographic whereabouts appears as a viable way of
engaging them more. This strategy has the potential to go
beyond simple global popularity, in order to consider items
that might not be noteworthy per se but that could become
so for users belonging to a certain geographically-deﬁned
community. This could aﬀect a wide set of services, ranging
from search to discovery tool and recommendation engines.
The surprising eﬀect of social sharing on the spatial prop-
erties of a video’s audience suggest that the relationship be-
tween social diﬀusion mechanisms and the popularity of con-
tent is more complicated than it would appear. In detail,
higher levels of social sharing appear to constrain, rather
than widely promote, the diﬀusion of a piece of content on
a more focused and less diverse set of geographic regions.
This ﬁnding appears in agreement with many recent results
on the spatial properties of social networks [3, 17], which
have found how geographic distance aﬀects social interac-
tion on online social networks, acting as a powerful proxy
for culture and language diﬀerences. Yet, the causality link
between social sharing and geographic popularity is to be
further studied.

At the same time, social diﬀusion mechanisms have been
studied on diﬀerent online platforms, investigating how in-
formation spreads by cascading through social links and how
this phenomenon can be modeled or predicted. Our results
opens new directions for the analysis of such social diﬀusion
mechanisms on online services: geographic and spatial fac-
tors could be taken into account to model how users choose
what content to share and which friends they want to share
it with. In addition, the interaction between geographic dis-
tance, social diﬀusion and online popularity could lead to
better classiﬁcation and predictive models for online videos
and online news.

At the same time, spatial locality of interest for online
content has the capability to inﬂuence large-scale storage
and delivery systems. For instance, as a majority of con-
tent items enjoy only local popularity, modern geograph-
ically distributed content delivery networks can preferen-

tially cache diﬀerent items in diﬀerent geographic regions,
exploiting how both social and spatial factors limit the dif-
fusion of online items beyond certain geographic scales. In
an era where billions of videos are streamed every day on the
global Internet, the prospect of a geographically diverse and
spatially-scoped Web could eﬀectively ease the load that the
skyrocketing amount of online video traﬃc imposes on the
networking infrastructure.

7. RELATED WORKS

There are two main research areas related to our work:
the analysis of the properties of online video services and the
investigation of the spatial properties shaping user behavior
on online services.

Online videos.

Research eﬀorts have focused on understanding the prop-
erties of YouTube videos and how their popularity can be
modeled, classiﬁed and predicted. One of the ﬁrst works on
YouTube focused on the popularity life-cycle of videos and
on the statistical properties of user requests, discussing the
impact of long-tail popularity on video discovery and con-
tent delivery infrastructure design [5]. The temporal dynam-
ics of video popularity has been also investigated, studying
how it evolves over time to build predictive models [7]: this
has sparked interest about the viralness of YouTube videos,
where individual video items become wildly popular thanks
to social diﬀusion mechanisms, even though a thorough un-
derstanding of such phenomenon is still to be achieved [9,
4]. Our investigation is diﬀerent than this body of works
since we study an entire sample of YouTube videos rather
than mainly popular ones; in addition, we address a diﬀerent
facet of YouTube video popularity, focusing on the novel as-
pect of its spatial properties in relation to video properties,
amount of social sharing and temporal evolution.

Other researchers have measured how users access YouTube
videos by monitoring local networks and studying how lo-
cal popularity does not correlate with global popularity and
how many videos enjoy high levels of interest even within
a conﬁned user population, suggesting how this can be ex-
ploited to provide local caching and proxying [10, 22]. We
extend this set of results by discovering similar patterns of
local popularity across the entire range of YouTube videos,
conﬁrming at a larger scale those results and building up on
them to provide new insight.

Spatial properties of user behavior.

The eﬀect of spatial distance on online user behavior has
only been recently addressed, as more information about
the location of users and of resources has become available,
thanks to new location-sensing technologies. Nonetheless,
one of the ﬁrst studies on the geographic scope of web re-
source predates such technologies and discusses methods to
compute the interest and the spatial spread of web pages [8].
Another work focuses on studying search engine queries to
estimate their geographic center of interest and their spatial
dispersion in the USA [2]. We adopt concepts already put
forward by these works, namely studying the spatial distri-
bution of item popularity by considering a focus location and
the dispersion around it. However, we adapt these concepts
to the YouTube scenario by deﬁning the view focus and the
view entropy measures across world regions.

tial properties of user interaction on online social services.
It has been found how the probability of having a social
connection between two individuals decreases as an inverse
power of their geographic distance, even though the ex-
act relationship is still under discussion [13, 11, 3]. Fur-
thermore, users exhibit heterogeneous socio-spatial proper-
ties, with geographic distance becoming less constraining as
users acquire more online social ties [17]. While these re-
sults focus on the structural properties of online social net-
works, it has also been discussed how social diﬀusion mecha-
nisms are constrained by spatial distance, with information
propagation preferentially occurring over short-range social
ties [16]. In particular, a recent study found how propaga-
tion of YouTube URLs on Twitter is widespread and prefer-
entially taking place between geographically close users [15].
Our ﬁndings conﬁrm these results, as we provide new evi-
dence that connects social mechanisms with spatial distance,
namely the fact that higher levels of social sharing tend to
limit the geographic spread of video popularity, conﬁrming
the eﬀect of geographic properties on online user behavior.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have seen that YouTube videos exhibit strong geo-
graphic locality of interest by studying a large corpus of
video items and using new measures to quantify their popu-
larity distribution across diﬀerent geographic regions. We
have discussed the impact that video properties have on
these measures, together with studying how social sharing
aﬀects the spatial popularity of a video and how these mea-
sures evolve over the lifetime of the video.

There are a number of directions that appear worth to be
pursued to extend these results. Predictive and classiﬁcation
models for video popularity could take spatial properties into
account to reﬁne their performance, while search and rec-
ommendation engines may exploit these spatial measures to
tailor their results and adapt them to the user’s geographic
location. Finally, availability of ﬁner-grained geographic in-
formation about video items and video views would make
spatial probabilistic models possible, exploring popularity
pattern at even smaller geographic scales.
