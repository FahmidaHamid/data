ABSTRACT
Micro-blogging systems such as Twitter expose digital traces
of social discourse with an unprecedented degree of resolu-
tion of individual behaviors. They oﬀer an opportunity to
investigate how a large-scale social system responds to ex-
ogenous or endogenous stimuli, and to disentangle the tem-
poral, spatial and topical aspects of users’ activity. Here we
focus on spikes of collective attention in Twitter, and specif-
ically on peaks in the popularity of hashtags. Users employ
hashtags as a form of social annotation, to deﬁne a shared
context for a speciﬁc event, topic, or meme. We analyze a
large-scale record of Twitter activity and ﬁnd that the evolu-
tion of hashtag popularity over time deﬁnes discrete classes
of hashtags. We link these dynamical classes to the events
the hashtags represent and use text mining techniques to
provide a semantic characterization of the hashtag classes.
Moreover, we track the propagation of hashtags in the Twit-
ter social network and ﬁnd that epidemic spreading plays a
minor role in hashtag popularity, which is mostly driven by
exogenous factors.

INTRODUCTION

Popularity plays a major role in the dynamics of online
systems. Public attention can suddenly concentrate on a
Web page or application [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], a Youtube video [7,
8, 9], a trending topic in Twitter [10, 11, 12], or on a story in
the news media [13], sometimes even in absence of an appar-
ent reason. Typically, after an initial increase of attention,
the focus will move elsewhere leaving as a trace a charac-
teristic activity proﬁle. Such popularity peaks are not only
of great relevance for the monetization of online content,

but also pose scientiﬁc challenges related to understanding
the mechanisms ruling their dynamics [2, 7, 4, 14, 11]. In
particular, speciﬁc features of the popular item under con-
sideration can now be related to its activity proﬁle by means
of semantic analysis and natural language processing of the
messages exchanged by the users [3, 15, 16].

Here we use data from the Twitter micro-blogging system
to investigate the relation between activity proﬁles over time
and content. There are several reasons for selecting Twit-
ter: It is one of the most popular online social networks, part
of its message stream is programmatically accessible to the
public [17], and the content of the messages is short, mak-
ing it amenable to automated processing. Twitter is used
as an hybrid between a communication media and an on-
line social network [10, 16] and hosts real-time discussion of
current topics of popular interest. We take advantage of the
practice introduced by Twitter users of attaching “hashtags”
to their messages as a way of explicitly marking the relevant
topics. Twitter has incentivated this practice by supporting
hashtags in their Web interface and in their programmatic
API, turning them into lightweight social annotations of the
information streams users consume. Here we focus our anal-
ysis on those hashtags that exhibited a popularity peak dur-
ing our observation period, and systematically analyze the
corresponding messages (“tweets”) by grounding the words
they contain in a semantic lexicon.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the
literature on Twitter and in particular the literature on tem-
poral patterns of Twitter activity. Section 3 describes the
Twitter dataset we used and the techniques we applied to
select popular hashtags and their usage patterns.
In Sec-
tion 4 we identify dynamical classes of hashtag usage and
relate them to the semantics of the corresponding tweets.
In Section 5 we relate the same dynamical classes to the
spreading properties of hashtags over the underlying social
network. Section 6 summarizes our ﬁndings and points to
applications and further research directions.

2. RELATED WORK

Several aspects of Twitter have been extensively investi-
gated in the literature, including its network topology [18,
19, 20], the relations and types of messages between users [21,
22], the internal information propagation [23, 24, 25], the
credibility of information [26, 27], and even its potential as

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 251an indicator of the state of mind of a population [28, 29, 30,
31, 32, 25].

The possibility that popular trends or hashtags could be
classiﬁed in groups have been discussed in Refs. [10, 16, 12],
and the eﬀect of semantic diﬀerences on the persistence of a
hashtag have also been considered [33]. The shape of peaks
in popularity proﬁles has been used to classify the events in
groups [7, 10, 34, 12]. The hypothesis that both the increase
and decrease of public attention follow a power-law-like func-
tional shape whose exponents deﬁne universality classes, in
parallel to what occurs with phase transitions in critical phe-
nomena, has been explored [7]. This approach, however, is
diﬃcult to apply to Twitter: the fast timescales involved and
the highly reactive nature of Twitter make the time series
very noisy and pose the challenge of characterizing activity
dynamics in a way which is both robust and scalable.

The causes that underlie the existence of distinct classes
of popularity are thought to be a combination of all the
mechanisms that drive public attention. News regarding a
popular item can propagate either over the social network
of the users of a given system – a so-called endogenous pro-
cess – or it can be injected through mass media (exogenous
driving). The duality between exogenous and endogenous
information propagation has permeated the analysis of pop-
ularity in several recent studies [7, 10, 8, 9], even though it
is not always clear how to distinguish between them based
solely on the shape of the respective popularity proﬁles [9].

3. DATA

Our dataset comprises about 130 million Twitter messages
or tweets posted between November 20, 2008 and May 27,
2009. The data were collected at Indiana University thanks
to their temporary privileged access to the Twitter data
stream [35]. Each tweet includes textual content, an au-
thor, the time at which it was posted, whether or not it was
in reply to another tweet, and additional metadata. The
collected tweets come from about 6.1 million unique user
accounts.

In order to build a representation of the social network
over which hashtag diﬀusion takes place, we queried the
Twitter REST API for the complete list of followers and
friends of 3.5 million users. We collected neighbor informa-
tion for 2.7 million of them, the discrepancy being accounted
for by users with a private proﬁle. Using this information
we constructed a directed follower network, where each edge
takes on the direction in which information ﬂows: if user A
follows user B, the respective social link points from B to A,
as A can see B’s status updates.
3.1 Hashtags Selection

For the identiﬁcation of topics, we extracted all the hash-
tags contained in the Twitter messages (by matching the
tweet content to the pattern “#[a-zA-Z0-9 ]* ”). Our dataset
includes about 400, 000 distinct hashtags (see Table 1). We
selected the most popular topics by restricting our data to
the hashtags used by at least 500 distinct users and to the
messages containing at least one of such hashtags. Based on
this selection, we used for the following analysis about 1.7
million tweets and 402 popular hashtags.
3.2 Activity Peak Detection

Like most systems driven by human actions, Twitter ex-
hibits bursty activity, circadian rhythms, and in general the

full temporal complexity of a large-scale social aggregate.
Because of this, there is no single natural scale for investi-
gating its temporal behavior, and the choice of a time scale
is not neutral with respect to the phenomena one can study
at that scale. Here we choose to investigate activity at the
scale of days, i.e., we do not study human dynamics at the
level of minutes and seconds, nor phenomena driven by the
circadian cycle, nor slower trends that develop over several
weeks of months. We analyze daily activity levels, and focus
on events that are meaningful at that scale, such as the wait
for a scheduled social event.

At the daily scale the popularity proﬁle of hashtags can
look very diﬀerent. On visual inspection the individual tem-
poral proﬁles of hashtag usage display behaviors that typ-
ically fall into one of the following three categories: con-
tinuous activity, periodic activity, or activity concentrated
around an isolated peak.

Continuous-activity proﬁles are those for which a rather
constant level of daily activity is maintained by the user
community (e.g., music). Hashtags with periodic activity
proﬁles display series of spikes spaced by one or more weeks,
or months (e.g., followfriday). Finally, activity proﬁles
with an isolated peak are characteristic of hashtags associ-
ated with a unique event to which a user community pays
attention for a limited span of time (e.g., oscars). In the
following we will concentrate on this class of hashtags.

To identify activity peaks, for every hashtag H we com-
pute the time series of daily activity, where the activity
nH (i) on day i is deﬁned as the number of tweets containing
H. In the following we will write n(i) to indicate the activity
level of a generic hashtag. We use a sliding window of 2L+1
days (L = 30) centered on day i0, T = [n(i0 − L), n(i0 − L +
1), . . . , n(i0 − 1), n(i0), n(i0 + 1), ..., n(i0 + L− 1), n(i0 + L)],
and let i0 slide along the activity time series for the hash-
tag. Within this window we evaluate the baseline hashtag
activity as the median nb of T . Then, we deﬁne the outlier
fraction p(i0) of the central day i0 as the relative diﬀerence of
the hashtag activity n(i0) with respect to the median base-
line nb: p(i0) = [n(i0) − nb]/ max(nb, nmin). Here nmin = 10
is a mininum activity level used to regularize the deﬁnition
of p(i0) for low activity values. We say that there is an
activity peak at i0 if p(i0) > pt, where pt is an arbitrary
threshold value that in the following we set as pt = 10. We
checked that diﬀerent values of the threshold do not change
signiﬁcantly our results, and that the same peaks can be
identiﬁed by using diﬀerent peak-detection techniques.

Of course it may happen that for a given hashtag H the
time series nH (i) exhibits more than one peak. Since we are
interested in isolated popularity bursts, we ignore all peaks
that are separated from other peaks by less than one week.
Finally, for every hashtag we select the peak (if any) with
the highest p(i0) and we oﬀset the day index so that for
all hashtags the activity peak occurs on day 0, as shown
in Fig. 1. Using this method we select 115 peaks of daily
hashtag activity: the corresponding hashtags are listed in

meaning and a coarse classiﬁcation.
3.3 Semantic Grounding

To correlate the temporal activity patterns with content,
we perform a simple semantic grounding of the tweets by
using the WordNet [36] semantic lexicon. For each tweet, we
pre-process the text by removing user mentions (@username),
hashtags, URLs and a standard set of English stop words.
Then, for each word we perform stemming (with the stan-
dard Porter algorithm), lemmatization, and we ﬁnally at-
tempt to look up in WordNet the corresponding synset (i.e.,
the basic node of the WordNet lexicon, a set of synonyms
that refer to a single concept). From now on we will refer
to WordNet synsets as concepts. Words for which no con-
cept can be looked up in WordNet are ignored.
If few or
no terms are successfully looked up in WordNet as English
words, we attempt to identify the tweet language: we run
the TextCat [37] language categorization algorithm on the
text and we discard the tweet if English is not included in
the top 10 most likely languages identiﬁed by TextCat.

Overall, the above analysis identiﬁes about 18, 000 distinct
concepts that are associated with the hashtags under study.
3.4 Social attention and popular hashtags

Typical examples of the activity proﬁles for the selected
hashtags are shown in Figure 1. The curves are centered
around the day on which the popularity reaches its maxi-
mum (day 0). The displayed time window spans one week
before and after the peak. In the top plots of Figure 1 the
activity of four sample hashtags is reported as a function of
time in days after the peak. The bars on the top right dis-
play the percentage of activity before, at and after the peak.
The four hashtags exhibit diﬀerent behaviors in terms of ap-
proach to the peak (dark blue bars) and relaxation after the
peak (light blue bars). The hashtag masters exhibits an an-
ticipatory pattern, with a gradual build-up of activity before
the peak. The hashtag winnenden, conversely, corresponds
to an unexpected event, with a sudden onset of activity fol-
lowed by a gradual relaxation. The hashtag watchmen dis-
plays both a gradual build-up of attention and a gradual
relaxation after the peak. Finally, the hashtag nsotu con-
centrates almost all of its activity during the single day of
the peak. In the middle plot row we show the activity of in-
dividual users as a function of time. Users who have posted
the hashtag at least once (within the observation interval)
are ranked according to the time of ﬁrst usage of the hashtag
(rank along the ordinate axis): early adopters lie at the bot-
tom and late adopters are at the top. For each user, colored
segments mark the times at which the hashtag under con-
sideration was used. The inset bar plots show the fraction
of users who used the hashtag more than once during the
selected time window. Finally, in the bottom plot row we
visualize the content of tweets as word clouds. Each word
cloud contains the 50 most frequent words, with font sizes
proportional to word frequencies. The patterns displayed
by these hashtags are representatives of the four classes of
activity peaks found in our analysis.

4. CLASSES OF POPULAR HASHTAGS

The possibility of classifying online popularity peaks in a
few discrete classes has been discussed in the literature [7,
10, 8, 12, 9]. Typically the classiﬁcation is done according

to the diﬀerent shapes or functional forms of the increasing
and decreasing parts of the popularity proﬁles. The origin
of these few classes has been linked in the literature to two
mechanisms that, to some extent, are present in most online
social systems: endogenous propagation of information over
the social network, and the injection into the system of in-
formation from exogenous online or oﬄine sources. This sce-
nario was tested for the evolution of popularity of YouTube
videos [7, 8] and has also been discussed for trending topics
or memes in Twitter [10, 12, 9]. The lack of a clear distinc-
tion between endogenous and exogenous information ﬂow
in Twitter means that the number of classes, the possible
functional shapes of the popularity proﬁles, and even the
importance of the endogenous/exogenous distinction are all
far from clear [9].

Here we take a diﬀerent approach and attempt to sim-
plify the possible scenarios by shifting emphasis from the
detailed time series of popularity to coarse-grained informa-
tion on the balance of activity before, during, and after the
popularity peak. To achieve this, for each hashtag exhibiting
a popularity peak we summarize the hashtag usage timeline
with the triple (fb, fp, fa) of the fractions of tweets posted
before (fb), during (fp) and after the peak (fa). By deﬁ-
nition these fractions satisfy fb + fp + fa = 1. We restrict
the computation to a two-week period centered on the peak
time, as shown in the examples of Fig. 1.

4.1 Identifying Classes

We identify hashtag clusters in the (fb, fa) space of in-
dependent parameters using a standard implementation of
the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [38, 39] to
learn an optimal Gaussian mixture model. The number of
components (clusters) of the mixture is set by using the
Bayesian Information Criterion, as well as by means of a
10-fold cross-validation, yielding in both cases the 4 clus-
ters shown in Fig 2. The clusters are robust with respect to
the initial conditions and parameters of the EM algorithms

Figure 1: Activity associated with four hashtags that exhibit a popularity peak: daily activity over time (top
row), individual user activity (middle) row, and word clouds of tweet content (bottom row).

(provided that care is taken to deal with the points on the
fb = 0 axis): 77% of the hashtags have a classiﬁcation ac-
curacy below 5%, and only 6% of them have a classiﬁcation
accuracy in excess of 20%.

Figure 3 shows the identiﬁed clusters in the 3-simplex
(fb, fp, fa). The marker representing each of the 115 se-
lected hashtag is colored and shaped according to the group
it has been classiﬁed into. The hatched area is the paramet-
ric space excluded by the constraint that hashtags should
have a peak-day activity of at least 10 times the baseline
daily activity (i.e., the excluded parametric space is due to
our selection of hashtags that exhibit a peak in their activity
timeline). The four groups of Fig. 3 correspond to diﬀerent
temporal patterns of collective attention, as illustrated be-
low in relation to the hashtags of Fig. 1.
(cid:129) Activity concentrated before and during the peak (or-
ange triangles). These hashtags correspond, by def-
inition, to anticipatory behavior, with users posting
increasing amount of content as the date of the event
approaches, followed by a sharp drop in attention right
after the event. See for example the hashtag #masters
(underlined in the ﬁgure) which was used to discuss
the 2009 Golf Masters.

(cid:129) Activity concentrated during and after the peak (pur-
ple circles). In this class we ﬁnd hashtags indicating
unexpected events that make an impact, such as the
#winnenden school shooting. The sudden onset of ac-
tivity is a reaction to the unexpected event, and it is
likely to be driven by exogenous sources such as com-
munication in mass media.

(cid:129) Activity concentrated symmetrically around the peak
(red squares). These hashtags have neither the purely

anticipatory nor the purely reactive behaviors illus-
trated above, and this may indicate a mix of exogenous
and endogenous factors building up collective attention
to a peak intensity, as a speciﬁc day approaches, and
then away from it as user attention shifts away. See
for example the case of the hashtag #watchmen, used
to discuss a blockbuster movie. The peak occurs on
the day of the movie release in theatres.

(cid:129) Activity almost totally concentrated on the single day
of the peak (green rounded square). These hashtags
correspond to transient collective attention associated
with events that are highly discussed only while they
happen, such as the 2009 State of The Union address
(#nsotu), or the transient large-scale malfunctions of
widely used Google services (#gfail).

These patterns are somehow expected, in the sense that
these are the only possibilities for the coarse-grained tem-
poral proﬁle of a hashtag with a popularity peak. However,
the existence of well deﬁned hashtag clusters, as well as their
stability, are far from trivial and indicate that coarse grain-
ing the temporal dynamics of collective attention as shown
here can expose robust indicators of the social semantics as-
sociated with hashtags. The presence of clearly separated
clusters may also be deeply linked to the diverse nature of
the mechanisms driving popularity in online social systems.
Details on the usage and origin of the hashtags shown in
Fig. 3 are available in Appendix A.
4.2 Social Semantics of Classes

The examples discussed above, such as those of Fig. 1,
point to important diﬀerences in the social semantics of the
diﬀerent classes of hashtags. In order to shed light on this

aspect, we systematically analyze the content of the tweets
associated with each group of hashtags, using the semantic
grounding described in Section 3.3. WordNet provides hi-
erarchical structures of concepts that can be made into a
single directed acyclic graph by adding a root “entity” node
as parent of the WordNet taxonomies. Thus, Wordnet can
be used to coarse-grain the semantics of the looked-up terms
by focusing on a given (high enough) level of the subsump-
tion hierarchy. Our interest here is to provide a semantic
ﬁngerprint of the content associated with the diﬀerent hash-
tag classes, in order to expose diﬀerences in their social se-
mantics. The concepts at depth 4 of the WordNet hierarchy
were identiﬁed as appropriate for this purpose, as that hi-
erarchical level provides a good enough semantic diversity
while featuring a small number of generic subsuming cate-
gories. We restricted our analysis to the concepts at depth
4 that occur most frequently in the text associated with the
hashtags under study: the right-hand side of Fig. 4 lists the
15 selected WordNet concepts, together with sample terms
that are subsumed by them.

To expose the semantic diﬀerences between hashtag classes
we proceed as follows: For each hashtag we compute a nor-
malized feature vector of the frequencies of occurrence of
the selected WordNet concepts. We then average this vec-
tor over all hashtag belonging to a given class and obtain
the class feature vectors of Fig. 4, where the radius of discs
is proportional to the normalized frequency of the corre-
sponding concept in a given class of hashtags. Clearly, dif-
ferent dynamic classes correspond to diﬀerent semantics of
the corresponding tweets. The content of hashtags with ac-

tivity concentrated before the peak has a stronger preva-
lence of concepts like “social events” and “time period” (e.g.,
easter), consistent with the social anticipation of a known
event. Conversely, hashtags whose activity is concentrated
after the peak, usually associated to unexpected events, in-
clude several marketing campaigns such as macheist, and
this is reﬂected in the prevalence of concepts like “free” and
“evidence”. Tags with the activity concentrated mostly on
the peak day correspond to events that attract the users’
attention for short periods of time, such as sport events
and media events (e.g., concepts associated with oscar, sub-
sumed by the “symbol” concept). The detailed annotations
of Appendix A allow to make contact between speciﬁc hash-
tags or hashtag classes and the information of Figs. 3 and
4. Notice that the observed selectivity between content and
activity proﬁles may open the door to content tagging tech-
niques based on popularity dynamics and on other behav-
ioral cues.

5.

INFORMATION SPREADING

Having identiﬁed classes of popular hashtags that diﬀer in
activity proﬁles and semantics, we now turn to investigating
whether such classes are also associated with distinct pat-
terns of information propagation. Similarly to the approach
of Ref. [7], we regard information spreading as an epidemic
process, where the behavior of using a given hashtag spreads
from one user to another. The relevant social network for
this epidemic process is Twitter’s follower network : when-
ever a user posts a given hashtag, her followers are exposed
to the hashtag and can decide to adopt it in turn. Of course,

Figure 4: Semantic makeup of the hashtag classes:
columns represent peak types and rows correspond
to topics, i.e., concepts in the WordNet semantic
lexicon. The radius of a circle is proportional to
the average normalized frequency of the topic in
the corresponding hashtag class. The displayed top-
ics represent the most frequently observed generic
concepts. Sample terms subsumed by them are re-
ported in parenthesis.

users can also start using the hashtag spontaneously, as a re-
sult of exposure to external events (elections, sport matches,
disasters, etc.) or to exogenous information sources.

5.1 Basic Features

The ﬁrst feature we analyze is the fraction of retweets
to total tweets in the messages associated with each hash-
tag under study. Retweets are forwarding actions in which
a tweet from a followed user is delivered to one’s followers
together with a reference to the source. Because of their na-
ture, retweets have been investigated as a mechanism for in-
formation diﬀusion in Twitter [23]. The fraction of retweets
is an indicator of how many (forwarded) copies are present
in the tweets associated with a hashtag, and provides in-
formation on the spreading attitude of the corresponding
topic. Retweets were identiﬁed both by checking for an ini-
tial “RT” marker or through tweet metadata. The top-left

Figure 5: Parameters controlling the spreading of
hashtags, broken down by hashtag class. Top left:
fraction of retweets to regular tweets. Top right:
fraction of seeders γ. Bottom left: fraction β of fol-
lowers that adopt the hashtag after seeing it. Bot-
tom right: average time τ between the ﬁrst tweet
with the hashtag and the last one.

panel of Figure 5 reports the fraction of retweets for the four
hashtag classes. A box plot is used to provide information
on the dispersion of parameter values inside each hashtag
class. Hashtags with the activity distributed symmetrically
around the peak or concentrated at the peak day have a
higher fraction of retweets. This supports the idea that
those hashtags are associated with a higher level of endoge-
nous activity, similarly to what happens for some YouTube
videos [7]. Conversely, hashtags characterized by activity be-
fore the peak are associated to anticipatory behaviors and
appear less prone to viral spreading.

The box-plot in the top-right panel of Fig. 5 reports the
fraction γ of users who adopt the hashtag when none of the
users they follow have used it before. In other words, γ es-
timates the fraction of “seeders” that inject the information
related to the hashtag into the social network. Although the
level of heterogeneity inside the four groups is high, we see
that the hashtags with activity concentrated after the peak
tend to have more seeders. This indicates that the propaga-
tion is probably fueled by exogenous factors, such as pub-
licity campaigns or mass media communication. A further
corroboration is provided by the semantic analysis of Fig. 4,
as these hashtags contain concepts such as “sign” (sign-up
for a service) , “account” (create an account) or “free” that
are usually associated with commercial campaigns that are
heavily diﬀused in traditional media.
5.2 Epidemic Parameters

The box-plot in the bottom-left panel of Fig. 5 reports
the average fraction β of a user’s followers who adopt the
hashtag after he or she has posted a tweet containing it.
In modeling epidemic processes, β is a measure of infec-
tiousness.
In this context, it bears information about the
capacity of a behavior or meme to propagate from a user to
her followers. The box-plot shows that β does not depend
strongly on the hashtag class and its median value is about
0.02. This might suggest the existence of a generic mech-

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 256anism controlling the propagation of the information over
the Twitter social network independently of the content or
popularity proﬁle of the hashtags. The estimation of both
γ and β depends on the sampling of the social network at
hand. However, an analysis made using sub-samplings of
the follower network obtained by cutting edges has showed
that β is relatively stable to the level of sampling, while γ is
more sensitive. Nevertheless, since our sampling of the net-
work is ﬁxed it is legitimate to compare the results obtained
for diﬀerent hashtags even in the case of γ.

Finally, in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 5 we report the
average time τ , in hours, between the ﬁrst tweet and the
last tweet with the same hashtag posted by each user (we
set τ = 0 for those users who post the hashtag only once).
That is, τ indicates the time during which users are likely to
spread their use of the hashtag to followers. The four hash-
tags classes display similar values of τ except for the case of
activity concentrated on the peak day. In that case, hash-
tags have the lowest τ value, since activity is concentrated
in a small period of time corresponding, for example, to a
short-term disruption of online services.

6. DISCUSSION

In summary, we performed an extensive analysis of the
Twitter hashtags that exhibit a popularity peak. Previous
work found that popularity peaks in online systems can be
clustered in a few prototypical classes according to the tem-
poral features of their popularity dynamics. Here we in-
troduce a simple way of coarse-graining the temporal usage
patterns of hashtags that exposes discrete dynamical classes.
The clusters we ﬁnd correspond to the four possible ways of
distributing the hashtag activity with respect to the day of
peak usage. Clusters are well deﬁned and the classiﬁcation
of hashtags is stable with respect to small perturbations. We
ground in a semantic lexicon the contents of tweets associ-
ated with popular hashtags, and ﬁnd insightful correlations
between the class a hashtag belongs to and the (social) se-
mantics of the associated content. In particular, hashtags
that are mostly active before reaching a peak usually deal
with scheduled social events or speciﬁc moments in time, in-
dicating an anticipatory collective behavior. Hashtag with
symmetric activity patterns across the peak seem to be asso-
ciated with endogenous propagation over the social network.
Hashtags that only exhibit a tail of activity after the peak
correspond to unexpected events or exogenous driving.

Furthermore, we measure standard parameters of epidemic
propagation over the on-line social network and relate these
parameter values to the diﬀerent hashtag classes, to unveil
patterns of injection or propagation of information. The
balance between internal propagation (endogenous) and ex-
ternal injection of information was assumed so far to be the
main explanation for the existence of diﬀerent clusters of
online popular events. Our results indicate that the content
type is also very important. For instance, the hashtags used
to discuss the “swine ﬂu” pandemic (top of Fig. simplex) or
a popular event such as the Oscars ceremony (bottom-left
of the simplex) show markedly diﬀerent popularity proﬁles
despite the fact that both attract a high level of attention
from the media. Both hashtags display high levels of ex-
ternal seeding, as well as relatively low levels of endogenous
propagation. Thus, the diﬀerent social semantics of these
hashtags is likely the cause underlying the observed diﬀer-
ences in activity dynamics.

We remark that a robust classiﬁcation into dynamical
classes of user attention was obtained by using very sim-
ple parameters computed on time series of daily popularity.
Contrary to other methods, which require the estimation
of power-law exponents for popularity growth, or the com-
putation of expensive correlations between high-resolution
activity time series, the parameters introduced here can be
easily computed in a scalable way. While they lack predic-
tive power, as they need a record of past activity to be com-
puted, they can support the discovery of speciﬁc behavioral
patterns in large-scale records of user activity. The robust-
ness of the proposed approach, if conﬁrmed in other settings,
could support implicit temporal tagging of the Twitter data
stream, where – for example – anticipatory behavior associ-
ated to a given date points to that date as a focus of collec-
tive expectation. The speciﬁc semantics that can be linked
to a given temporal proﬁle may be used to mine collective
attention in order to construct implicit annotations of time-
lines on the basis of social media streams. Of course, this
requires an extensive work of validation that falls outside
the scope of the present work. Progress in this direction
will requires more reﬁned content analysis by means of nat-
ural language processing and sentiment analysis, as well as
validation in user studies or crowd-sourced settings.
