ABSTRACT
Researchers and social observers have both believed that
hashtags, as a new type of organizational objects of informa-
tion, play a dual role in online microblogging communities
(e.g., Twitter). On one hand, a hashtag serves as a book-
mark of content, which links tweets with similar topics; on
the other hand, a hashtag serves as the symbol of a com-
munity membership, which bridges a virtual community of
users. Are the real users aware of this dual role of hash-
tags? Is the dual role aﬀecting their behavior of adopting
a hashtag? Is hashtag adoption predictable? We take the
initiative to investigate and quantify the eﬀects of the dual
role on hashtag adoption. We propose comprehensive mea-
sures to quantify the major factors of how a user selects con-
tent tags as well as joins communities. Experiments using
large scale Twitter datasets prove the eﬀectiveness of the
dual role, where both the content measures and the com-
munity measures signiﬁcantly correlate to hashtag adoption
on Twitter. With these measures as features, a machine
learning model can eﬀectively predict the future adoption of
hashtags that a user has never used before.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, microblogging sites such as Twitter have rapidly
grown from yet another social networking service into one of
the most prevalent type of social media. According to a re-
cent statistic [36], Twitter has accumulated over 200 million
users as well as hundreds of billions of short messages (i.e.,
tweets). Due to the convenience of posting short messages,
thousands of tweets are posted every second and from every
corner of the world, assembling the “SMS of the internet” [9]
and the collection of “global conversations” [13].

The overwhelming volume of tweets and the tremendously
sparse information in each individual tweet have made it

extremely diﬃcult for a user to ﬁnd and track interesting
topics. Hashtag, as a brand-new organizational object of in-
formation, has emerged from this context and soon become
widely adopted by Twitter users to facilitate their naviga-
tion in this deluge of information. Figure 1 presents two
examples of hashtags and the results of searching the two
hashtags in Twitter. As simple as a user-composed keyword
starting with the # symbol, a hashtag eﬀectively coordinates
relevant tweets and people in the microblogging media.

The use of hashtags has brought convenience to Twitter
users in various ways. As a user-deﬁned index term of con-
tent, a hashtag links relevant topics and events together [8],
making it much easier to assess the semantics of a tweet. As
a result, the exposure of tweets containing certain hashtags
are maximized in information retrieval and navigation. For
example, tweets related to iPhone are easily retrieved by a
single click on the hashtag #iphone (see the left panel of
Figure 1 (a)). To this end, a hashtag plays the role of a
social bookmark: annotating the content, being shared to
other users, and assembling the folksonomy.

Is this the only role of a hashtag? Sociologists, media
observers, and computer scientists have all noticed another
role. Beyond a bookmark of content, a hashtag serves as the
symbol of a community [34, 11, 12, 28]. Indeed, a hashtag
enables users to identify and participate in online chats des-
ignated by the tag [34]. Birds of a feather can be easily found
and connected by tracking a particular hashtag, as shown
in the right panel of Figure 1. To this end, a hashtag de-
ﬁnes a virtual community of users with the same background
(e.g., “#Umich”), the same interest (e.g., “#iPhone”), or in-
volved in the same conversation or task (e.g., “#www2012”,
“#VoteForObama”). A user joins such a community by sim-
ply including that hashtag in her own tweets.

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 261The observations above have clearly indicated a critical
hypothesis that when posting a hashtag, the Twitter users
are aware of the dual role it plays – as a unique indicator
of both the topic of the content and the membership of a
community [25, 15]. In other words, by creating a hash-
tag, a user either invents and shares a new bookmark (of
content), or initializes and spreads a coat of arm (of a com-
munity), or both. By adopting an existing hashtag, a user
either presents her interest in a topic, or presents her intent
to obtain a community membership, or both. Should this
hypothesis hold, one would expect the analysis of hashtags
contribute signiﬁcantly to the understanding of user inter-
ests and behaviors in microblogging sites.

Interestingly, even before being formally tested, this hy-
pothesis has already been directly or indirectly leveraged
in various studies of microblogging. Indeed, in existing lit-
erature, hashtags have been eﬀectively utilized as critical
features for various tasks of text or social network analysis,
including topic detection and tracking [3], text classiﬁcation
[30], community identiﬁcation [24], and link prediction [35],
etc. On one hand, hashtags do perform eﬀectively in most
of these tasks as a speciﬁc type of features. On the other
hand, because of the lack of a formal conclusion on the role
of hashtags, it is diﬃcult to explain why the involvement
of hashtags works in some tasks but not in others. There’s
little insight on how to make the best use of hashtags.

In this work, we take the initiative to conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of how the dual role of a hashtag aﬀects
hashtag adoption. Our goal is to formally test whether the
content role and the community role aﬀect users’ behavior
of adopting hashtags that they have never used before. To
achieve this, we focus on how hashtags are adopted and used
by Twitter users, and investigate whether this behavior can
be explained as the behavior of bookmarking the content
and/or the behavior of joining a community. Should the hy-
pothesis hold, the following observation would be expected:
1) the major factors that aﬀect the behavior of content tag-
ging and joining communities will also signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the adoption of hashtags; and 2) by carefully measuring the
magnitude of these factors, it is feasible to make predictions
of future adoption of hashtags.

The contribution of our work is not to investigate how
to utilize hashtags to enhance particular data mining tasks.
Instead, our study provides a foundation of the rational-
ity of using hashtags in these tasks: why it works; and in
what context it might work better. Accordingly, our goal is
not to diﬀerentiate the role of an individual hashtag, but to
provide a macroscopical analysis of the two roles. The pre-
dictive analysis in our work also serves as a feasibility study
of hashtag recommendation, which provides insights to the
future construction of recommender systems of hashtags.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start
with a discussion of related work in Section 2. In Section 3
we introduce comprehensive measures to quantify the major
factors of content tagging and joining communities, followed
by a demonstrative analysis of how these measures correlate
with the hashtag usage (Section 4). A formal regression
analysis is presented in Section 5 to test the predictive power
of these measures to the adoption of hashtags. In Section 6,
we develop machine learning methods to predict the future
adoption of hashtags of individual users, which serves as a
feasibility study of hashtag recommendation. We conclude
our work in Section 7.

2. RELATED WORK

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst formal anal-
ysis to test the predictive power of the dual role of hashtags
on hashtag adoption. Between the two roles, the role of con-
tent tagging has connected hashtags to existing social tag-
ging systems such as del.icio.us 1 and Flickr 2. Those tags
are also generated by the users to annotate content such as
Web pages or photos and are being shared to other users.

The second role as the symbol of a community member-
ship, on the other hand, has diﬀerentiated hashtags from
traditional social tags. Playing this role, hashtags are em-
ployed as a mechanism to participate in online conversa-
tions [19] and join virtual communities [34, 12]. This role
has been carefully examined in individual events such as
scientiﬁc conferences [22, 11]. Letierce et al. [22] concluded
that annotating messages by hashtags reveals a strong de-
sire from the users to join in the discussion related to the
conference. Ebner et al. [11] argued that conference com-
munities in Twitter are built based on the adoption of one
speciﬁc hashtag. Therefore, a hashtag is not only a tag of
content but also the tag of a community. The community
role of a hashtag presents in its functionalities to identify
a community, form a community, and allow users to join a
community - a role never played by traditional social tags.
In general, social tags (such as those in del.icio.us, Ci-
teULike, Flickr, Last.fm and YouTube) serve for two pur-
poses [25, 15]: i) organizational, to facilitate description or
navigation, and ii) social, to facilitate resource exposure and
sharing. This is quite diﬀerent from the user’s intent of
joining a community, which presents the community role of
a hashtag. Because of the conversation nature of Twitter,
the social interactions in Twitter communities are far more
frequent than those in other social media. In other words,
a Twitter community started by hashtags has much richer
inner-community communications, compared to a ﬂat set of
people who happen to use the same bookmark.

Our measurement of the factors of content tagging or join-
ing communities has largely beneﬁted from existing litera-
ture. The factors aﬀecting content tagging are inspired from
the studies of traditional content tagging systems [25, 15],
especially tag recommender systems [20, 14]. The factors of
joining communities are inspired from the literature of so-
cial network analysis, in which this is modeled as a cascading
behavior [1, 10], or the adoption of innovation [32, 5].

The predication analysis in our work is in general related
to the prediction of user behavior in online communities [33,
18, 17, 23]. Sen et al. [33] mentioned that tag selection in
MovieLens is aﬀected by community inﬂuence and evolving
personal tendency such as preferences and beliefs about the
tags they apply. Heymann et al. [18] predicted tag usage
in Del.icio.us based on page text, anchor text, surrounding
hosts, and other tags for URLs. Hecht et al. [17] predicted
location information through users’ tweets.

Finally, our work is also related to the recommender sys-
tems in microblogging communities, including the recom-
mendation of followee [16], content [7] and conversations [6]
in Twitter. Our work presents a feasibility study of hashtag
recommendation, instead of aiming at constructing a partic-
ular recommender system.

Our fundamental hypothesis is that a hashtag plays the
dual role of both the signature of the content and the symbol
of a community membership. Should it hold, the user’s be-
havior of adopting a hashtag would be interpreted as either
the behavior of bookmarking a content, or the behavior of
adopting a community membership, or both. In this section,
we present comprehensive measures to quantify the major
factors of tag selection and joining communities.

3.1 Basic Notations

We focus on the behavior of a Twitter user u to post
a hashtag h at time t in one of his tweets d, which is a
short document with a limit of 140 characters. Adopting
the common practice in information retrieval, we represent
a tweet as a bag of words, i.e., d = {w1, ..., wN}. We denote
D as a large collection of tweets, U as a set of twitter users,
and H as a set of hashtags.

Multiple types of relationships exist between Twitter users:
a user u can follow another user v, become a friend (i.e., fol-
lowee) of v, or mention v in one of his own tweets, or quote
and redistribute one of v’s tweets by retweeting it. In our
task, we particularly focus on the retweeting relationship.
Rather than the following-followee relationships, a retweet-
ing relationship is a much stronger indicator of social inﬂu-
ence, which is a major driving force of cascading behavior
in online communities [10]. Indeed, it has been proved in
literature that while the number of followers sheerly repre-
sents a user’s popularity, the following relationship reveals
little about the social inﬂuence of a user [4].
In contrast,
the retweeting relationship, akin to the practice of forward-
ing interesting blog posts and links via email, can be un-
derstood as a form of adoption of innovation and diﬀusion
of information, and reveals salient aspects determining the
inﬂuence [4].

Networks of users can be constructed according to a spe-
ciﬁc type of relationship. For example, a retweet network
of users can be deﬁned as a directed graph Grt = (V, E),
where every vertex u ∈ V denotes a Twitter user and ev-
ery directed edge (u, v) ∈ E denotes that the user v has
retweeted at least one tweet of the user u. The direction of
the edge (i.e., u → v) corresponds to the direction of infor-
mation diﬀusion. An edge can be further weighted by rtu,v,
the number of times that u was retweeted by v. The larger
rtu,v is, the more frequently v has been inﬂuenced by u.

For a user u, we then denote the set of users he has
retweeted as Iu, corresponding to the in-links of u in Grt.
The set of users who have retweeted u is denoted as Ou,
corresponding to the out-links of u. Clearly, the behavior
of users in Iu can directly inﬂuence the behavior of u, while
the behavior of u can directly inﬂuence users in Ou.

Definition 1: Hashtag Adoption.

We deﬁne a hashtag h as used by a user u if it appears in
one of her tweets. We call a hashtag usage an “adoption” if
an existing hashtag h is for the ﬁrst time used by a user
u in her tweet d. Thus we exclude the scenario that h is
invented by u. The adoption is spontaneous if the tweet d is
composed by the user herself instead of by retweeting others.

The adoption of hashtags is the user behavior we focus on
in this study. Given a time-stamped collection of tweets D, a
set of users U , and a retweeting network Grt, we now present

formal measures to quantify the major factors of selecting a
content tag and adopting a community membership.

3.2 Measures Related to Content Tagging

We start with the role of a hashtag as an indicator of
content. A user uses a hashtag to characterize his interest,
to annotate the topic of a tweet, and to share the content to
his peers. To this end the adoption of a hashtag is similar to
the adoption of a bookmark in Del.icio.us, or a tag in Flickr,
or a user-selected keyword in weblogs. What factors aﬀect
the user’s selection of such a content tag? How can they be
measured? Clues can be found from literature, especially
from those about recommender systems of tags [14].

To summarize, a tag recommender system usually ﬁlters
tags by optimizing a number of objectives, closely corre-
sponding to the major factors of how a user selects a tag.
These factors include: 1) the popularity of the tag; 2) the
relevance to the content; and 3) the closeness to the user’s
personal preference. While the popularity of a tag is easy to
measure, the relevance objective is usually modeled by infor-
mation retrieval methods such as adaptive ﬁltering [2]. The
preference objective, on the other hand, is usually optimized
using collaborative ﬁltering techniques (e.g., [31]).

Largely inspired by this body of existing literature, we
discuss how to measure the two corresponding characteris-
tics of a hashtag: the magnitude of relevance to the content
and the closeness to the user preference.

Relevance

We ﬁrst measure the relevance between a hashtag and the
content it annotates. It is worth giving attention that there
are two diﬀerent scenarios in tag recommendation. In some
cases when the document to be annotated is known (e.g.,
suggesting bookmarks for a particular web page), the rele-
vance is measured between the tag and the document. In
more other cases, the recommendation is made independent
to a particular document (e.g., suggesting tags on the front-
page of Delicious).
In such cases, the relevance is judged
between the tag and a dynamic proﬁle of the user. The user
proﬁle is usually constructed by accumulating all historical
content generated or consumed by the user. Such a method
is known as adaptive ﬁltering in information retrieval [2].
Note that the extremely sparse information in the tag string
is usually ineﬀective in the assessment of relevance.
It is
common practice to construct and use a rich representation
of a tag based the context - all documents it annotated.

In our task, we adopt the intuition of adaptive ﬁltering
by measuring the “user-level” relevance instead of a “tweet-
level” relevance. This is not only because a tweet is ex-
tremely short, but also because we care about whether a
user will adopt a hashtag sometime in the future, instead of
whether she will adopt a hashtag in a particular tweet. This
leads to the following family of measures:

Definition 2: Relevance Measures.

The relevance between a hashtag h and a user u is mea-
sured by a similarity function of two proﬁles, sim(Dh, Du),
where the hashtag proﬁle Dh integrates all tweets containing
h and the user proﬁle Du consists of all tweets posted by u
up to a given time point.

Preference

We then measure how close a hashtag is tied to the per-

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 263sonal preference of a user. Such a personalized preference
plays a critical role in tag recommender systems [14]. Among
all the tags relevant to the content, a user usually prefers the
ones she has used before, or the ones that are similar to those
she has used. In the problem of hashtag adoption, we are
interested in hashtags that have not been used by the user.

tivity of a community is either correlated to the popularity
of the hashtag, or can be interpreted as a form of indirect
social inﬂuence, where the community members propagate
their inﬂuence through the inner-community links. We fo-
cus on two essential factors of the adoption of community
membership: prestige and inﬂuence.

Definition 3: Preference Measures.
The degree to which a hashtag h is close to the personal
preference of u is measured by an aggregate function f (·)
of the similarity between h and all hashtags ever used by
u. Let Hu be the set of hashtags u has ever used up to
a given time point, a preference measure takes the form of
f ({sim(h, h

(cid:3) ∈ Hu}).

(cid:3)

)|h

Note that the similarity between two hashtags is com-
puted based on a richer proﬁle of two hashtags instead of
the tag string. The proﬁle is constructed using either all
the tweets h appeared in, Dh, or all users who have used h,
Uh. Any reasonable aggregate function f (·) introduces an
instantiation of the preference measure, such as the maxi-
mum, minimum, sum, or a weighed average.

It is worth mentioning that while the relevance measure
reﬂects the intuition behind many content ﬁltering services
[2], the preference measures reﬂect the intuition behind a
common approach to collaborative ﬁltering - to ﬁrst estab-
lish the similarity among items, and then recommend items
that are similar to the items already rated by the user [31].
Please also note that both the relevance and the preference
are time-variant, as both the semantics of a hashtag and the
personal interest/preference of a user change fast over time.

3.3 Measures Related to Joining Community
Hashtags also play a relatively implicit role as the sym-
bol of a community membership. While a user can also use
traditional types of social tags such as Flickr tags to ﬁnd peo-
ple with similar interests, a community clearly diﬀers from
a ﬂat set of people by the rich interconnections among the
members. Indeed, we calculated the average level of inter-
actions within a “hashtag community,” based on the number
of retweets, replies, and mentions between community mem-
bers. The level of interaction is signiﬁcantly higher than
among random users. Based on our computation, the net-
work density of hashtag communities is around a thousand
times larger than the network density among users using the
same tag in Flickr, LiveJournal, or YouTube.

To this end, the user behavior of adopting a hashtag can
be interpreted as the adoption of a community membership
(i.e., to join a community). In social network analysis, the
behavior of joining a community is usually treated as an
instantiation of information diﬀusion or cascading behavior
[10, 1], similar to the adoption of innovation [32, 5]. By
adopting the membership of a community, the newcomer
adopts the norm of the community.

Our second task is to quantify the major factors that aﬀect
the behavior of joining communities. We extract a summary
of several factors from the literature investigating the adop-
tion of community membership: 1) how large the community
is; 2) how prestigious the community members are; 3) how
much the user is inﬂuenced by his friends already in the
community; and 4) how actively the community members
interact. Apparently, the size of a “hashtag community” is
highly correlated to the popularity of the hashtag. The ac-

Prestige

We start with the measurement of the prestige of commu-
nity members designated by a hashtag. To do this, we ﬁrst
propose a way to measure the prestige of individual users.
The measurement of prestige is a classical problem in social
network analysis, leading to many possible instantiations
[10, 27]. Intuitively, if a user is followed/retweeted by many
users, she appears to be more prestigious; she appears to
be even more prestigious if her followers are prestigious. In
this work, we adopt the PageRank score [29], which has been
proven to be a robust measure of prestige. Similar to the
context of ranking Web pages or scientiﬁc papers, PageR-
ank of Twitter users can be computed based on either the
following/followee graph or the retweet graph. We believe
the retweet network is a better choice because retweeting
implies an endorsement of another user’s content, similar to
linking to a Web page or citing a scientiﬁc article.

Definition 4: Prestige Measures.

Let Uh be a hashtag community, essentially a set of users
who have used the hashtag h. The prestige of a hashtag com-
munity is measured by the result of an aggregate function
of the prestige score of each existing member of the hashtag
community, f ({pu|u ∈ Uh}). pu is realized as the PageR-
ank score of the vertex u in the retweet network Grt. Once
again, any reasonable aggregate function f (·) introduces an
instantiation of the prestige measure.

Inﬂuence

We then propose measures for the social inﬂuence, also
known as the “neighborhood eﬀect.” If many of my friends
have adopted an innovation, or have joined a community,
so will I [1]. To measure this eﬀect, a critical issue is how
to identify the “neighborhood,” or the people who have an
inﬂuence on the behavior of the user. Once again, we prefer
to utilize the retweeting relationship instead of the follow-
ing/followee relations. This is because a retweeting behavior
provides a much stronger indication of cascading behavior
and social inﬂuence.

We quantify the social inﬂuence of a hashtag community
on a user by aggregating the inﬂuence of its individual mem-
bers on that user. Diﬀerent realizations of individual inﬂu-
ence deﬁne diﬀerent instantiations of the inﬂuence measure.

Definition 5: Influence Measures.

Let Uh be a hashtag community, essentially the set of users
who have used hashtag h. The magnitude of inﬂuence Uh
has on a user u is deﬁned as a function of the inﬂuence of
individual users v ∈ Uh on user u given the retweet network
structure Grt, g({s(v, u)|v ∈ Uh}, Grt). The strength of in-
ﬂuence of a single user v on u, s(v, u), is either realized as
a constant if v ∈ Iu and zero otherwise, or proportional to
the prestige of v, or proportional to the frequency that u has
retweeted v’s tweets, rtv,u (as a surrogate of the frequency
that v has inﬂuenced u before), etc.

WWW 2012 – Session: Behavioral Analysis  and Content Characterization in Social MediaApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France 264The function g(·) can be realized as any reasonable ag-
gregate function of all the individual inﬂuences s(v, u). In
this case, the inference measure excludes the eﬀect of the
community members who are not u’s direct in-neighbors. A
more general realization of g(·) propagates the inﬂuence of
each community member through her out-neighbors to the
whole retweet network. In other words, the inﬂuence of a
particular user and a community of users is now “smoothed”
on the retweet network Grt. Such a measure also reﬂects
the inner-connectivity of a hashtag community.

Like relevance and preference, prestige and inﬂuence mea-
sures are also time-variant because the retweeting behaviors
change frequently over time.
3.4 Other Measures

Our discussion has been focused on factors of tagging con-
tent and joining communities, namely relevance, preference,
prestige, and inﬂuence. Each of the four factors can be in-
stantiated as a family of various measures, according to the
particular selection of functions. Beside these four, we are
aware of many other potential factors of hashtag adoption.
They characterize either the property of the hashtag (e.g.,
the popularity of the hashtag), or the user (e.g., whether
she has been actively posting), or the community deﬁned by
the hashtag (e.g., the size of the community). In fact, some
of these factors, such as the popularity of hashtag and the
size of the hashtag community, are highly correlated (with
a correlation higher than 0.9). Not surprisingly, the num-
ber of people adopting a hashtag is highly correlated to the
number of times the hashtag is used.

Factors like these may be highly correlated to the behav-
ior of hashtag adoption. The pure analysis of only these
factors, however, will not directly help us identify the two
roles of the hashtag. They are either correlated with both
roles, or neither of them. Nevertheless, these factors should
still be included in our analysis, in order to comprehensively
understand the eﬀect of the content-speciﬁc and community-
speciﬁc factors in the context of hashtag adoption. Below
we present a broader range of measures that are likely to
predict the adoption of hashtags but not relevant to testing
the dual role:

Popularity: the number of times a hashtag has been

posted; or the number of users who adopted the hashtag.

Length: the number of characters in the hashtag string.
Freshness: the age of a hashtag, or the length of period

since its ﬁrst burst.

Degree: the number of people a user has retweeted or

been retweeted by.

Activeness: the frequency or the ratio of tweets, retweets,

and hashtags a user has posted in the past.

We refer to these measures as role-unspeciﬁc measures,
which would provide a baseline prediction model not spe-
ciﬁc to either of the roles. Together with the four families of
content and community speciﬁc measures (role-speciﬁc fea-
tures), these general measures will be instantiated in Sec-
tion 4 and used in the regression and prediction analysis.

4. DATA AND FEATURE INSTANTIATION
We have introduced formal measures to quantify role-
speciﬁc factors of hashtag adoption, including the relevance,
preference, prestige, and inﬂuence. Do the measures make
sense? Are these factors truly correlated with the use of
hashtags? As a proof of concept, we ﬁrst conduct a straight-

forward exploratory analysis to demonstrate the correlation
between each of the factors and the user behavior of hashtag
usage. We start with an introduction of the datasets and the
speciﬁc instantiations of the measures used in our analysis.
4.1 Datasets

Two real world datasets are collected from Twitter.com,

corresponding to two diﬀerent sampling strategies.

The ﬁrst dataset collects all the tweets posted by a sam-
ple of political users between March 25th 2007 to December
13th 2010 [24]. The sample frame of the political users con-
sists of House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates during
the midterm elections in the United States (i.e., year 2010).
The twitter accounts of these candidates are matched by
querying Google with the names of the candidates and key-
word “Twitter.” Then a manual process is applied to inspect
and ﬁlter the top 3 results so that only the Twitter accounts
operated by the candidates or their staﬀ are kept in the col-
lection. Diﬀerent from [24], we do not further ﬁlter the set of
users according to their activity level. Hence, the dataset,
notated as the Politics dataset, contains 373, 439 tweets
and 9, 343 hashtags posted by 1, 029 users.

The second dataset is constructed from a random sam-
ple of tweets at a much larger scale. This sample is drawn
from a roughly 5% sampled stream of tweets between June
1 2009 and December 31 2009. This dataset, notated as
the Stream dataset, includes roughly 19 million users, 49
million unique hashtags, and 476 million tweets.
4.2
Given a time period Δ, a user u, and a hashtag h which
was created before Δ, we construct a user-hashtag pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5).
We then use the hashtag usage, i.e., the number of times h
is used by u during Δ, to surrogate the level of interest of
the user on the hashtag. If h hasn’t been used by u during
and before Δ, the level of interest will be set to zero.

Instantiation of Measures

We now present all the particular instantiations of the
general measures proposed in Section 3. These instances
are used in the explanatory analysis to demonstrate their
correlation to hashtag usage. They will also be used as in-
dependent variables in the regression and features in the
prediction model to predict hashtag adoption.

Note that most of the measures, including the the four
role-speciﬁc measures, are sensitive to time. In our analy-
sis, we carefully select time windows of various lengths to
instantiate these measures. We introduce additional nota-
tions related to the selection of time windows: Δ as a time
window, nΔ
u,h as the frequency u uses h during Δ, nrΔ
u,h
as the frequency of hashtag usage in retweets, and DΔ
u,h as
set of tweets containing h that are posted by u during Δ.
Table 1 summarizes all features instantiated from both the
role-unspeciﬁc measures (i.e., baseline features) and the four
role-speciﬁc measures. Please note that the similarity of two
hashtags is computed based on either the tweets or the users
using the hashtags, instead of based on the hashtag strings.
4.3 A Demonstrative Analysis

Now that we have the particular instantiations of the
adoption behavior and the features according to the role-
speciﬁc factors, we present a simple correlation analysis to
demonstrate the relationship between these role-speciﬁc fac-
tors and a user’s degree of interests in a hashtag (surrogated
by the frequency of using a hashtag).

more than 5 hashtags during a 10-day time window between
November 1st and November 10th 2009 from the Stream
dataset, and randomly sampled 30,106 users from them. We
then collected all hashtags tweeted by these 30,106 users
during this period, from which we obtained 269,712 user-
hashtag pairs. We then obtained 40,427 user-hashtag pairs
from the Politics dataset between August 1st and Octo-
ber 30th 2010. Note that identical time window is used to
calculate the hashtag usage and the features.

To make it easier to visualize, we bin the values of each
feature into buckets, so that each bucket contains the same
number of user-hashtag pairs. The plots in Figure 2 present
the correlation between the degree of interest in a hashtag
and the role-speciﬁc factors. Not surprisingly, the degree of
interest of a user in a hashtag highly correlates with all four
factors: relevance to the content, personal preference of the
user, community prestige, as well as social inﬂuence. Intu-
itively, this suggests that the factors of selecting a content
tag and the factors of joining a community are both aﬀecting
the behavior of using a hashtag.

The result of this demonstrative analysis looks promising.
However, the simple correlation analysis does not provide
evidence on whether these factors have the predictive power
of the adoption of a hashtag, or whether they would make
a joint eﬀect in reality. To draw convincing conclusions, we
proceed with a formal regression analysis.

5. REGRESSION ANALYSIS

Beyond the intuitively promising results from the corre-
lation analysis, we are looking for formal evidences on 1)
whether each of the proposed measures has a predictive
power of hashtag adoption; 2) if yes, how signiﬁcant the
eﬀect is; and 3) whether the eﬀect remains signiﬁcant when
the factors interplay with each other.

We thus conduct a regression analysis with the hashtag

adoption behavior as the response (dependent) variable. Three
groups of users are constructed from our two datasets:

1) a group of users selected from the Politics dataset,

namely the Politics group;

2) an interest-based group of users selected from the Stream

dataset, namely the Movie group;

3) a group of users randomly sampled from the Stream

dataset, namely the Random group.
5.1 Experiment Setup

We formulate the regression analysis such that the de-
pendent variable corresponds to whether or not a user will
adopt a hashtag in a time period in the future. The indepen-
dent variables correspond to particular instantiations of the
measures in Section 3, either role-speciﬁc or role-unspeciﬁc.
Since it is impossible to observe future events, we hold out
the observations from a time window of 10 days, Δ1, to sur-
rogate the hashtag adoption behaviors in the future. Values
of all independent variables are computed only based on the
observations in a time period Δ0 prior to Δ1.

We prepare the data of our regression analysis as follows:
1) Given a dataset and a time window Δ1, we extract
either the complete set of users or a sample of users, all of
which have been using hashtags recently (i.e., within 10 days
prior to the held-out period Δ1). The sampling process will
be discussed in the next subsection.

2) For each user u selected in 1), we collect all hashtags

posted by u in the held-out period Δ1 (i.e., in the “future”)
but have not appeared in any tweet of u before Δ1. These
hashtags are “adopted” by the user in the held-out period.
Every such pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5) is formatted as a data point in the
regression analysis, with the outcome variable set to 1.

3) For each user u selected, we randomly sample a set of
hashtags from up to 10 days prior to Δ1, which have not
been used by u in either Δ1 or ever before. These hashtags
are representatives of those that exist but are not adopted
by the user. Every such pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5) is also formatted as a
data point, with the outcome variable set to 0.

In the regression analysis, we use 10 days between Novem-
ber 11th 2009 and November 20th 2009 as the held-out pe-
riod Δ1 for the Movie and the Random group. For the
Politics group, we partition the period between August 1st
and October 30th 2010 into nine equivalent time windows
and employed each of them as a held-out period. The length
of each held-out period Delta1 is thus also 10 days. For all
data points sampled through the above procedure, we com-
pute the values of all the independent variables (i.e., one par-
ticular instantiation for each role-speciﬁc or role-unspeciﬁc
measure) based on all the tweets posted within 30 days be-
fore Δ1 and the snapshot of the retweet network right before
Δ1. In other words, Δ0 is designed as the 30-day time win-
dow prior to Δ1, with respect to each particular realization
of Δ1. Below we provide more details on how the users and
user-hashtag pairs are sampled.

5.1.1

Sample Users

The ﬁrst task of data preparation is to select the set of
users from a given dataset. As for the Politics dataset, we
simply select all users who have used at least one hashtag
within 10 days before the held-out period Δ1, representing
active hashtag users. For the Stream dataset, however, it
is computationally costly to run the analysis on all the 17
million users. We thus apply the following two sampling
frames: an interest-based sample and a random sample.

Interest-based sampling

Our ﬁrst sampling frame targets at users with a focused
aspect of interest. We chose “movie” as our target aspect
because i) many trending topics are related to movies ac-
cording to the “Top Twitter Topics” by Mashable3, and ii)
people discuss a lot on movie related topics in real life.

In particular, we select the set of users from the Stream

dataset using the following snowball sampling procedure:

1) Construct the retweet network from the complete col-

lection of the Stream dataset.

2) Select top 3 most popular Twitter users from Twellow4

in category “movies” as seeding users.

3) Following the out-links in the retweet network, we col-
lect all the ﬁrst-order and second-order neighbors of the
seedling users. With such a process, we have selected users
who have either retweeted the three seedling users, or have
retweeted another user who have retweeted them.

Combing the seedling users, their ﬁrst-order and second-
order out-neighbors, a pool of 178,323 Twitter users is con-
structed. A further process selects a set of users who have
posted at least one hashtag within 10 days before Δ1. In

the end, we obtain 8,029 users for this group, and we name
the group as the Movie group.

Random sampling

Another sampling strategy is to randomly select users
from the entire dataset. We gather all users that appear
in the Stream dataset, and randomly select a set of users
who have posted at least one hashtag within 10 days prior
to Δ1. In the end, we collected 15,038 users for this group,
which is named as the Random group.

5.1.2

Sample Negative Examples

Given a set of users, it is straightforward to generate data
points (i.e., user-hashtag pairs) with a positive outcome of
hashtag adoption. The data points with a negative outcome
(i.e., the event that a hashtag is not adopted), however, is
trickier. The simplest way is to create a negative exam-
ple for each existing hashtag (i.e., within 10 days before the
held-out period Δ1) that a user did not use during Δ1. How-
ever, the massive number of hashtags simply makes the neg-
ative examples dominating the collection, diluting all useful
signal. Thus, for each user, we randomly sample negative
examples proportional to the number of positive examples
(i.e., number of hashtags adopted by this user).

5.2 Results of Regression Analysis

We employ logistic regression to predict the adoption of
hashtags in the held-out time period Δ1 from features com-
puted based on Δ0 prior to Δ1. One instantiation of each
measure is included. We set the time window Δ0 as the
period of 30 days prior to Δ1. To comprehensively under-
stand the predictive power of the role-speciﬁc measures, we
also incorporate baseline features into the regression analy-
sis. Table 2 presents the results of the regression analysis.

Apparently, all the four role-speciﬁc measures have a sig-
niﬁcant and positive predictive power of hashtag adoption,

even when merged together with all baseline measures. One
baseline measure, the variable Popularity in the Movie and
Random group, yields a negative coeﬃcient in the regres-
sion. This is because the popularity of a hashtag is highly
correlated with the sum of prestige of hashtag users (e.g.,
with a correlation over 0.9196 in the Movie group). How-
ever, such correlation in the Politics group is lower, thus
yielding a positive coeﬃcient for Popularity. Indeed, when
we remove the Prestige variable from the regression, the co-
eﬃcient of Popularity becomes positive in the two groups
(and remain signiﬁcant). The Length of hashtags presents
a negative relationship with hashtag adoption, possibly be-
cause people tend to adopt short and concise hashtags.

The results of the regression analysis thus provide a much
stronger evidence that both the content role and the com-
munity role aﬀect hashtag adoption. All four role-speciﬁc
factors we presented have a signiﬁcant positive predictive
power to the adoption of hashtags.

6. PREDICTION ANALYSIS

The regression analysis has proved that all the role-speciﬁc
measures are predictive to the adoption of hashtags. This
reassures our hypothesis that the dual role of a hashtag af-
fects the adoption. We are, however, moving forward to
investigate the feasibility of constructing an eﬀective predic-
tion and recommender systems. Unfortunately, the regres-
sion analysis doesn’t tell how an eﬀective prediction system
can be constructed based on these measures, or how hashtag
recommendation can be done. To test the feasibility of hash-
tag recommendation, we proceed with building a machine
learning model to predict the adoption of new hashtags in
the future. Compared to the regression analysis that serves
as a white box to interpret the eﬀect of the measures, this
analysis provides a black box that aims at optimizing the
accuracy of of predictions.

6.1 Experiment Setup

Signiﬁcant at the: *** 0.01, ** 0.05, or * 0.1 level, paired t-test.
Rel.: Relevance; Pref.: Preference; Inf.: Inﬂuence; Pres.: Prestige

Consistent to the regression analysis, we setup three ex-
periments over three groups of users, and sample negative
examples accordingly. Held-out time periods are employed
to surrogate the “future.” The prediction problem is cast
as a binary classiﬁcation task: whether or not a user will
adopt a new hashtag in a held-out period. The performance
of such a classiﬁer is evaluated by the accuracy of the pre-
dicted classes. Strictly, the behavior of a user to adopt a
hashtag in her own tweets is quite diﬀerent from adopting
a hashtag by retweeting others. The former is spontaneous
and the latter is passive. We further diﬀerentiate the tasks
of predicting hashtag adoption in all tweets, retweets, and
user-composed tweets (i.e., non-retweets) respectively.

Diﬀerent from the regression analysis, we train the pre-
diction model with a training dataset and assess the eﬀec-
tiveness with a separate test dataset. To do this, we select
diﬀerent pairs of “history” (Δ0) and “future” (Δ1) time win-
dows. We then use some “history-future” pairs to train the
prediction model, and use other time window pairs to test
the model. From each pair of time windows, we sample a
collection of user-hashtag pairs as data examples. For each
data example, we then compute all the features in Table 1
based on Δ0, and identify the label (positive or negative)
based on whether the hashtag is adopted by the user during
Δ1. The number of positive and negative samples in our
training and test datasets are presented in Table 3.
6.2 Results and Discussion

We ﬁrst employ an SVM classiﬁer with all baseline fea-
tures in Table 1. The RBF kernel is adopted, and 5-fold

cross-validation is used to select parameters. The perfor-
mance of the SVM predictor is presented in Table 4. Such
a baseline model performs reasonably well - with 68% accu-
racy on the Politics group and around 75% on both the
Movie group and the Random group, comparing to a 50%
accuracy of random guess. We then add the all features in-
stantiating each of the four role-speciﬁc measures into the
classiﬁer, to test the four families of measures one by one,
and then altogether. The inclusion of each of the four fam-
ilies of measures has improved the prediction performance
signiﬁcantly, with a few exceptions of the Prestige measures.
In all three groups, the mixture of all four families of features
has further improved the prediction accuracy.

The only exception is the prestige measure on the Movie
and Random group. Surprisingly, the inclusion of the pres-
tige measure even decreases the prediction performance when
all tweets are considered. While on the Politics group, the
prestige features performed signiﬁcantly well. This is possi-
bly due to the way prestige is computed. Of both the Movie
group and the Random group, prestige is computed based
on the global retweet network of millions of users, most of
which are not part of the group. Therefore, the prestige
is global and unspeciﬁc to the community of the group. Of
the Politics group, however, the retweet network is speciﬁc
to the community. The prestige is thus relatively “localized”
and more speciﬁc to the user group [4]. Therefore, we further
conducted an experiment to remove the prestige measures
from the Movie and the Random group. The accuracy of

to 82.00%, and the accuracy over Random group increased
from 84.03% to 84.35%.

Interestingly, predicting the hashtag adoption in retweets
seems to be easier than predicting the behavior in sponta-
neous tweets (Movie and Random). The exception is the
Politics group, where the candidates prefer to tweet rather
than to retweet (Table 3). In general, it is reasonable that
the prediction of content in retweets is easier than the pre-
diction of spontaneous tweeting behavior.

With all features included, the best prediction model achieves

an accuracy around 80% among all datasets. This is a
promising result, suggesting the feasibility of building ef-
fective recommender systems of hashtags in Twitter.

7. CONCLUSION

We presented a formal empirical analysis to test how the
dual role of hashtags in Twitter aﬀects hashtag adoption.
Results of a correlation analysis, a regression analysis, and a
prediction analysis all suggest that a hashtag serves as both a
tag of content and a symbol of membership of a community.
The measures we propose to quantify the factors of tagging
content or joining communities all present signiﬁcant pre-
dictive power to the adoption of hashtags. The prediction
analysis using a SVM predictor provides a feasibility study
of hashtag recommender systems, which suggests a promis-
ing future direction of research.
