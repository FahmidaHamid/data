ABSTRACT
Wikipedia becomes one of the largest knowledge bases on
the Web. It has attracted 513 million page views per day in
January 2012. However, one critical issue for Wikipedia is
that articles in diﬀerent language are very unbalanced. For
example, the number of articles on Wikipedia in English has
reached 3.8 million, while the number of Chinese articles is
still less than half million and there are only 217 thousand
cross-lingual links between articles of the two languages. On
the other hand, there are more than 3.9 million Chinese Wi-
ki articles on Baidu Baike and Hudong.com, two popular
encyclopedias in Chinese. One important question is how to
link the knowledge entries distributed in diﬀerent knowledge
bases. This will immensely enrich the information in the on-
line knowledge bases and beneﬁt many applications. In this
paper, we study the problem of cross-lingual knowledge link-
ing and present a linkage factor graph model. Features are
deﬁned according to some interesting observations. Exper-
iments on the Wikipedia data set show that our approach
can achieve a high precision of 85.8% with a recall of 88.1%.
The approach found 202,141 new cross-lingual links between
English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike.

INTRODUCTION

Cross-lingual knowledge linking is the task of creating
links between articles in multiple diﬀerent languages that
reports on the same content. Cross-lingual knowledge link-
ing not only globalizes the knowledge sharing of diﬀerent
languages on the Web, but also beneﬁts many online appli-
cations such as information retrieval and machine transla-

tion. For example, [20] explores cross-lingual links in ma-
chine translation and [30] studies how to improve informa-
tion retrieval by leveraging cross-lingual knowledge links.
The project of DBpedia [6][4] provides a semantic represen-
tation of Wikipedia in which multiple language labels are
attached to individual concepts. The idea of cross-lingual
linking has already become the nucleus for the linked da-
ta [6].

However, most traditional resources are monolingual, such
as Cyc [23] and WordNet [25] in English, HowNet [12] in Chi-
nese. Wikipedia tries to deal with this problem by providing
information in diﬀerent languages. Wikipedia contains 19
million articles in 281 languages. Articles in diﬀerent lan-
guages are interlinked. However, the number the articles in
diﬀerent languages is very unbalanced. Figure 1 shows the
number of articles in 12 diﬀerent languages on Wikipedia.
As it can be seen that there are 3.8 million English articles,
but only 382,000 Chinese articles on Wikipedia. This makes
it infeasible to create cross-lingual links between articles of
diﬀerent languages with a large coverage.

On the other hand, there are several separated Wik-
i knowledge bases on the Web. For example, Baidu Baike
and Hudong.com are two Chinese Wiki knowledge bases con-
taining more than 3.9 million articles. Ideally, automatical-
ly creating cross-lingual links between these Chinese Wiki
knowledge bases and the English Wikipedia would be very
useful. However, at present, the work is mainly taken by
manual, which is obviously tedious, time consuming, and er-
ror prone. In existing literature, a few approaches have been
proposed for ﬁnding missing cross-lingual links in Wikipedi-
a [29, 31]. However, as we mentioned before, the number
of articles in diﬀerent languages is very unbalanced. For
most English articles, we will be not able to ﬁnd the corre-
sponding Chinese version. To the best of our knowledge, no
previous work has extensively studied the problem of creat-
ing cross-lingual links across diﬀerent knowledge bases (e.g.,
the English Wikipedia and the Chinese encyclopedia Baidu
Baike).

In this paper, we try to systematically study the prob-
lem of cross-lingual knowledge linking across multiple Wiki
knowledge bases. The problem is non-trivial and poses a set
of challenges.
(cid:15) Linguistics. Existing methods for ﬁnding cross-lingual
links heavily depend on translation tools.
Such a
method often results in high precisions, but low recall-
s. Can we ﬁnd some language-independent features for
mining cross-lingual knowledge links?

(cid:15) Model. There are diﬀerent kinds of information that

could be used in the knowledge linking problem such
as article links, categories and authors, and they are
correlated with each other. How to deﬁne a model
to incorporate both the local features of articles and
relations of cross-lingual links together?

(cid:15) Eﬃciency. Wiki knowledge bases contain thousands
and millions of articles. How to develop an eﬀective
and eﬃcient algorithm that can deal with both com-
plex and large data sets?

In order to solve the above challenges, we ﬁrst empirically
investigate several important factors for cross-lingual knowl-
edge linking and then propose a factor graph model to solve
the knowledge-linking problem. Our contributions include:
(cid:15) We formally formulate the problem of knowledge link-
ing across Wiki knowledge bases in diﬀerent languages,
and analyze important factors for cross-lingual knowl-
edge linking.

(cid:15) We present a uniﬁed model for solving cross lingual
knowledge linking problem: Linkage Factor Graph
(LFG) model. Eﬀective candidate selection method
and distributed learning algorithm enable LFG scale
to large data sets.

(cid:15) We evaluate our proposed approach on existing cross-
lingual links in Wikipedia; it achieves high precision
of 85.8% with a recall of 88.1%. Using our model,
we successfully identify 202,141 new cross-lingual links
between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, which
doubles the number of existing cross-lingual links on
Wikipedia.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows, Section 2
formally deﬁnes the problem of knowledge linking and some
related concepts; Section 3 presents some motivational anal-
ysis on collected data sets; Section 4 describes the proposed
knowledge linking approach; Section 5 presents the evalua-
tion results; Section 6 outlines some related work and ﬁnally
Section 7 concludes this work.

2. PROBLEM FORMULATION

In this section, we formally deﬁne the knowledge linking
problem. Here, we ﬁrst deﬁne the Wiki knowledge base as
follows according to mechanism of the Wiki knowledge bases.

Definition 1. A Wiki knowledge base is a collection
of collaboratively written articles, each of which deﬁnes a
speciﬁc concept.
It can be formally represented as K =
faign
i=1, where ai is an article in K and n is the size of
K.

Articles are the key elements in a Wiki knowledge base.
Each article describes a speciﬁc concept. Articles are con-
nected with categories, authors, and other articles. Thus
an article ai 2 K can be represented as a ﬁve-tuple
(T (ai); I(ai); O(ai); C(ai); U (ai)), where T (ai) denotes the
title of the article; O(ai) is the set of outlinks of ai, which
denotes the set of articles that are mentioned in the content
of ai; I(ai) is the set of inlinks of ai, which denotes the set
of articles that link to ai; C(ai) represents category tags of
ai, and U (ai) represents the article’s authors.

Definition 2. Knowledge linking. Given two Wiki
knowledge bases K1 and K2, knowledge linking is the process
of ﬁnding, for each article ai 2 K1 from knowledge base K1,
an equivalent article aj 2 K2 in knowledge base K2. When
the two Wiki knowledge bases are in diﬀerent languages, we
call it the cross-lingual knowledge linking problem.

Here, we say two articles are equivalent if they semanti-
cally describe a same subject or topic. Figure 2 shows an
example for a possible knowledge linking result.

As shown in Figure 2, the article “Anaerobic exercise” is
from English Wikipedia and the other article “无氧运动” is
from Baidu Baike. There is not a cross-lingual link from
“Anaerobic exercise” to any article in Chinese on Wikipedi-
a. In the cross-lingual knowledge linking problem, our goal
is to ﬁnd an equivalent article “无氧运动” in Baidu Baike
for the English article “Anaerobic exercise” from Wikipedi-
a. In order to ﬁnd the equivalent relations between articles,
diﬀerent features of articles can be considered. Figure 2
highlights some useful features in the two articles, including
title, outlinks, categories and authors. Please note that we
are more interested in the link-based features, instead of the
linguistic-based features. This is because the former is more
general and can be easily adapted to other languages while
the latter is heavily dependent on the speciﬁc language. Giv-
en this, the knowledge base can be represented as a graph
of linked articles, which is referred to as Citation Graph.

Definition 3. Citation Graph. A Wiki knowledge base
is represented as a citation graph CG(K) = (A; L), where

the node set A represents all the articles in K, edge (ai; aj) 2
L denotes a link from ai to aj, satisfying aj 2 O(ai) and
ai 2 I(aj).

In this paper, we try to solve the knowledge linking prob-
lem as predicting the label (equivalent or not equivalent) of
article pairs between two Wiki knowledge bases. Given two
Wiki knowledge bases, we ﬁrst build their Citation Graphs,
and then construct a Pair-wise Connectivity Graph of two
Citation Graphs, which is deﬁned as follows.

Definition 4. Pair-wise Connectivity Graph. Given
two graphs G1 = (A1; L1) and G2 = (A2; L2), the Pair-wise
Connectivity Graph (PCG) of them is

where each element in the node set V denotes a node-pair
between A1 and A2; the set of edges E in P CG(G1; G2) is
established as follows:

(a1; a2) 2 L1 ^ (b1; b2) 2 L2 () ((a1; b1); (a2; b2)) 2 E

Figure 3 shows an example of the constructed PCG of t-
wo graphs. There are two graphs, each of them having 3
nodes. The constructed PCG between them (Cf. the right
of Figure 3) contains 9 nodes representing all the possible
node-pairs of two graphs. PCG can represent the linking
relations of node-pairs between two graphs, we use PCG to
capture the interaction of cross-lingual links between two
Wiki knowledge bases. Our proposed approach takes PCG
of two Wiki knowledge bases as input and solves the knowl-
edge linking problem by predicting the label (equivalent or
inequivalent) of nodes in the PCG.

3. DATA OBSERVATIONS

3.1 Data Collection

What are the fundamental factors underlying the forma-
tion of cross-lingual knowledge links? We ﬁrst use existing
cross-lingual links in Wikipedia to investigate which factors
are of important for knowledge linking. Here, we down-
load English Wikipedia and Chinese Wikipedia dumps from
Wikipedia’s website and extract cross-lingual links between
them. The English Wikipedia dump was archived in April
2011, and the Chinese Wikipedia dump was archived in Oc-
tober 2011. Table 1 shows some statistics of the collected da-
ta sets. We have extracted 180,807 cross-lingual links from
English Wikipedia to Chinese Wikipedia, and 205,608 cross-
lingual links from Chinese to English. Finally, by merging
them together, we obtain 217,689 cross-lingual links. We
have also extracted 35,294 cross-lingual links between cate-
gory pages in Chinese and English.

Based on the above data sets, we ﬁrst investigate what
for predicting the cross-lingual
factors will be helpful
links between Wiki articles.
In particular, we study the
correlation of the following factors with the cross-lingual
links: (1) Link homophily: do articles linking to or linked
by equivalent articles tend to be equivalent?
(2) Cate-
gory homophily: do articles have semantically equivalent
category tags tend to be equivalent? (3) Author interest:
are authors’ interests useful for ﬁnding cross-lingual links?
We randomly selected 10,000 English-Chinese article pairs
connected by cross-lingual
links from Wikipedia. We
generate all possible 10; 000 (cid:2) 10; 000 article pairs from the
selected articles; 10,000 of them are equivalent pairs and the
others are inequivalent pairs. Considering all these article
pairs as a sample set, we make some analyses to ﬁgure out
whether the above factors are helpful to knowledge linking.

Link homophily. If two articles cite two other articles
which have an equivalent relationship, we say the two
articles have a common outlink. Similarly, if two articles
are cited by two other equivalent articles, we say they have
a common inlink. We calculate the probabilities of being
equivalent conditioned on the number of common outlinks
and inlinks in the data set. As shown in Figure 4, the prob-
abilities of being equivalent grows as the number of common
outlinks and inlinks increase. It is obvious that the number
of common links is relevant to the equivalent relation of
articles, and the inlinks seems more important than outlinks.

Category homophily. If two articles belong to two cat-
egories which have an equivalent relationship, we say they
have a common category. Figure 5 shows the probability
of two articles be equivalent conditioned on the number
of common categories between them.
It clearly shows a
close correlation between common categories and equivalent
relationship. When the number of common categories is
more than 10, the probability of equivalent relation is close
to 1.0, 20 times higher than the probability when they only

have one common category.

Author interest. We presume that if two authors share
similar interests, their articles will have a higher probability
to be equivalent than that of two articles edited by random
authors. Here, we simply deﬁne authors’ interests by those
categories to which the authors’ edited articles belong.
We choose authors who have edited more than 50 articles
in both English and Chinese Wikipedia. Figure 6 shows
the distributions of authors over the number of categories
in two languages respectively.
It appears to be normal
distributions that most authors participated in a reasonable
number of categories, and only a few have extremely
small or large number categories. Therefore, most users
concentrate on a ﬁxed number of categories, and we may
use author interests in the knowledge linking problem.

We also calculate the percentage of article pairs that have
at least one common inlink, outlink, or category respectively.
Figure 7 shows that a large portion of equivalent articles
have common links and categories, with a probability much
higher than that of two random articles. For outlinks, it has
a similar pattern: the probability of two equivalent articles
sharing a common outlink is 15 times higher than that of
two random articles.

According to the above analyses, we have the following

summaries:

(cid:15) Common links and common categories have obvious
correlations with cross-lingual links, but it seems that
if a factor has higher correlation, it will have low cov-
erage of cross-lingual links.

(cid:15) Author interest would be an important factor to iden-

tify the equivalent relationships.

(cid:15) Equivalent articles are very likely to share inlinks, out-

links, or categories. The probability is more than 15
times higher than that of two random articles.

4. THE PROPOSED APPROACH

In this section, we describe our proposed model and its

learning algorithm in detail.
4.1 Linkage Factor Graph Model

Factor graph [22] assumes observation data are cohesive
on both local features and relationships. It has been suc-
cessfully applied in many applications, such as social inﬂu-
ence analysis [34], social relationship mininig[19, 35, 37, 33],
and linked data disambiguation [10]. In this work, we for-
malize the knowledge linking problem into a linkage factor
graph model, which is shown in Figure 8. Given two Wik-
i knowledge bases K1 = fA1; L1g and K2 = fA2; L2g, let
EL = fei = (ai1 ; bi2 )gp
i=1 be p existing cross-lingual links
2 A2, jA1j = n and
between K1 and K2, ai1
jA2j = m. The input of the LFG model is P CG(K1; K2).
Each node (ai1 ; bi2 ) in P CG(K1; K2) is mapped to a ob-
served variable xi in LFG. There is also a set of hidden
variables Y = fyign(cid:1)m
i=1 , representing the labels (equivalent
or inequivalent) of the observed variables.

where f =< fout; fin; fcate; fauth > is a vector of feature
functions; (cid:11) deﬁnes the corresponding weights; and variable
xi corresponds to article pair (ai1 ; bi2 ). Functions fout, fin,
fcate and fauth are similarity functions based on outlinks,
inlinks, categories and authors. The similarity functions are
deﬁned as follows:

(a) Outlink similarity function:

it computes similarities
between articles based on the equivalent articles in their out-
links.

knowledge bases.

(d) Author interest similarity function: it computes sim-
ilarities between articles based on their authors’ mutual in-
terests. In order to compute interest similarity between two
authors, we ﬁrst represent each author as a vector of cate-
gories they have participated, then compute the angle of two
authors’ feature vectors, as shown in Figure 9. Let s(u1; u2)
be the interest similarity of two authors, the author interest
similarity of two articles is deﬁned as

where g(yi; yj) is a function to specify whether there is a link
from node i to node j in the P CG(K1; K2); g(yi; yj) = 1
if there is a edge from node i to node j, otherwise 0. Edge
feature function is used to consider the relations between
nodes in the model, which is based on the assumption that
articles links to other two equivalent articles tend to be e-
quivalent, too. We should notice that similarity functions
fout and fin capture the relations between candidate cross-
lingual links and existing ones, but g(yi; G(yi)) is used to
model the relations within candidate cross-lingual links.

(3) Constraint feature function
Here, we set a rule that one article from K1 can only
have cross-lingual link with one article from K2, which is
consistent with real circumstances. Therefore, we deﬁne the
constrain feature function as

h(yi; H(yi)) =

expf

(cid:13)T h(yi; yj)g

(8)

∑

where H(yi) denotes the set of labels conﬂicting with yi
according to the 1-to-1 linking constraint. h is the contraint
function, h(yi; yj) = 0 if yi = 1 and yj = 1, otherwise 1.
4.2 Model Learning and Inference

Given a set of labeled nodes in the LFG, learning the
model is to estimate a optimum parameter conﬁguration (cid:18) =
((cid:11); (cid:12); (cid:13)) to maximize the log-likelihood function of p(Y ).
Based on Equtions 1-8, the joint distribution p(Y ) can be
written as

The general idea is to use two steps, one step for calculat-
ing E
p(cid:18)(Y jY L)S and the other step for calculating Ep(cid:18)(Y )S,
to estimate the gradient of a parameter (cid:18) wrt the objective
function (Eq. 10). Interested readers please refer to [35] for
details of the algorithm.
After learning the optimal parameters f(cid:18)g, we can infer
the unknown labels by ﬁnding a label conﬁguration which
maximizes the joint probability p(Y )

(cid:3)

Y

= argmaxY jY L p(Y )

(12)

To do the inference in the above equation, we again per-
form the two-step LBP to compute marginal probabilities.
Finally, each node in LFG is assigned with label that maxi-
mizes the marginal probability.
4.3 Candidate Selection and Distributed

Learning

Finding cross-lingual links between two large Wiki knowl-
edge bases is a challenging problem, because the number
of nodes in LFG model will increase sharply.
In order to
handle large scale knowledge linking problems, we ﬁrst use
a candidate selection strategy to reduce the number of n-
odes in LFG, that is only article pairs that have at least one
common outlink are mapped to nodes in the LFG model.
According to the observation on existing cross-lingual links
in Wikipedia, this candidate selection criterion can eliminate
a large number of unnecessary nodes. Thus complexity of
the resultant LFG can be eﬀectively reduced within a small
loss of recall.

We also implement the learning algorithm of LFG based
on MPI to enable distributed learning.
In the process of
distributed learning, the LFG is ﬁrst divided into sever-
al subgraphs that are assigned to slave computing nodes.
Then LBP is performed on each slave nodes to compute the
marginal probabilities and the parameter gradient. There
is a master node collects and sums up all gradients from
subgraphs, and updates parameters by gradient descent
method. For details, please refer to [35].

5. EXPERIMENTS

In this paper, the proposed approach for cross-lingual
knowledge linking is a general model.
It can be used to
ﬁnd cross-lingual links between any Wiki knowledge bases in
diﬀerent languages. In this section, we ﬁrst evaluate our ap-
proach on existing Chinese-English cross-lingual links within
Wikipedia. And then we use our approach to ﬁnd English-
Chinese links between Wikipedia and Baidu Baike.
5.1 Experiment Settings
5.1.1 Dataset
In order to evaluate our approach, we construct a dataset
that contains article pairs from English Wikipedia and Chi-
nese Wikipedia. We randomly select 2,000 English articles
with cross-lingual links to Chinese articles from Wikipedia,
and then pick out the corresponding 2,000 Chinese articles.
2; 000 (cid:2) 2; 000 article pairs are generated from the selected
Chinese and English articles. Among all these article pairs,
those 2,000 pairs linked by cross-lingual links are labeled as
positive examples, and the rest of article pairs are labeled
as negative examples.
5.1.2 Comparison Methods
We deﬁne four state-of-the-art cross-lingual linking meth-
ods as the comparison methods. They are translation based
method Title Matching (TM), Similarity Aggregation (SA)
based method, classiﬁcation based method Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and another classiﬁcation based method
(SVM-SC) based on the work of Sorg and Cimiano [31].

(cid:15) Title Matching (TM). This method ﬁrst translates
the titles of Chinese articles into English by Google
Translation API [1], then matches the translated ti-
tles with English articles. For each article pair, if two
articles have strictly the same English titles, they are
considered as equivalent articles.

(cid:15) Similarity Aggregation (SA). This method aggre-
gates diﬀerent similarities of each article pair into a
combined one. Then for each Chinese article, select
the English article having the largest similarity with
it to establish its cross-lingual link. Here, we compute
outlink similarity, inlink similarity, category similari-
ty and author interest similarity for each article pair,
which are the same as deﬁned in Section 4. For each
article pair (ai1 ; bi2 ), its diﬀerent similarities are ag-
gregated by computing their average value:

1
4

Sim(ai1 ; bi2 ) =

(fout + fin + fcate + fauth)

(13)
(cid:15) Support Vector Machine (SVM). This method
ﬁrst computes the four similarities deﬁned in Section 4
for each article pair, and then train a SVM [9] classiﬁ-
cation model on the known cross-lingual links, and pre-
dict the relationships of new article pairs. Compared
to our approach, SVM only consider the similarity of
articles’ local features, it does not take the relations
of predictions and any constraints into account. Here,
we use SVM-Light package [3] in our experiment.

(cid:15) SVM-SC. Sorg and Cimiano [31] deﬁned several
graph-based and text-based features between Wiki ar-

ticles, and also trained a classiﬁer to ﬁnd missing cross-
lingual links between German Wikipedia and English
Wikipedia. Here we train a SVM with their features
on evaluation dataset, and compare the results with
our approach.

We use precision, recall and F1-score to evaluate diﬀerent
knowledge linking methods. For SVM, SVM-SC and LFG,
we conduct 3-fold cross validation on the evaluation dataset.
LFG uses 0.001 learning rate and runs 3000 iterations in
all the experiments, SVM runs with the default settings in
SVM-Light package. All experiments are carried out on a
Windows 2008 server with 1.87GHz CPU (4 cores) and 6
GB memory.
5.2 Results Analysis

5.2.1 Performance Comparison
Figure 10 shows the performance of 5 diﬀerent methods.
According to the result, the TM method gets a really high
precision of 99.5%, but its recall is only 32.1%. SA does
not achieve good results by using simple averaging strategy.
SVM and SVM-SC both use the same classiﬁcation model
but with diﬀerent features.
SVM gets better precision
while SVM-SC gets better recall, SVM-SC outperforms
SVM by 0.8% in terms of F1-score. LFG achieves the best
recall and F1-score among all these methods. Compared
to the SA method, LFG outperforms it by 8.0% in terms
of F1-score. LFG and SVM both using the same training
data, they have similar precisions, but LFG outperforms
SVM by 12.3% in terms of recall, and has a 6.5% increase
of F1-score. Therefore, our LFG model can discover more
cross-lingual
links by considering the relations between
article pairs. LFG also performs better than SVM-SC in
terms of both precision and recall.

We also evaluate LFG by TOP-k evaluation. For each
Chinese article, we ﬁnd all the nodes in LFG model related
to it. Then TOP-k nodes are selected according to a ranking
determined by the marginal probabilities p(yi = 1). We
deﬁne TOP-k-Precision as the percentage of Chinese articles
that have correct equivalent articles in its Top-k candidate

set. We set k = 1; 2; :::; 5 respectively and calculate the
TOP-k precisions of LFG.

Figure 11 shows the result of TOP-k evaluation. The
precision grows as k increases, LFG achieves 92.3% precision
when k = 5. Therefore, if we do not want to ﬁnd the exact
cross-lingual links, LFG can also provide candidates of cross-
lingual links of high precision.

5.2.2 Factor contribution analysis
How much does each factor contribute to the LFG model?
In order to get some insight to this question, we perform
an analysis to evaluate the contribution of diﬀerent factors.
Here, we run LFG 5 times on the evaluation data, and each
time remove one factor from LFG. Table 2 lists the results
of ignoring diﬀerent factors.

According to the decrement of F1-scores, all these factors
are useful in predicting new cross-lingual links. It is reason-
able to evaluate the importance of each factor by the de-
crease of F1-score without that factor. So we can rank these
factors in a descending order of importance as inlinks, out-
links, relations, categories and authors’ interests. Although
the factor of authors’ interests is less important than oth-
er factors, we ﬁnd it is indeed helpful to improve the per-
formance of LFG. Also, LFG achieves a 3.1% increase of
F1-score by considering the relations among article pairs.
5.3 Discover new links between Wikipedia

and Baidu

The motivation of our work is to ﬁnd cross-lingual links
across Wiki knowledge bases to get more equivalent arti-
cle pairs in diﬀerent languages. Therefore, we use LFG to
discover cross-lingual links between English Wikipedia and
Baidu Baike (a large scale Chinese Wiki knowledge base).

cross-lingual links between English and Japanese. Their
method works in two steps, it ﬁrst selects candidates of miss-
ing links based on cross-lingual similarities between English
and Japanese Wikipedia articles, and then trains a classiﬁ-
er to predict whether a given candidate of missing links is
correct or not. These two methods try to ﬁnd the missing
links within Wikipedia, while our proposed approach aims
to ﬁnd cross-lingual links across diﬀerent Wiki knowledge
bases. Furthermore, some features used by these two meth-
ods are not available in the task of ﬁnding cross-lingual links
between Wikipedia and other Wiki knowledge bases. For ex-
ample, Sorg and Cimiano used the orthographical similarity
between English and German, which cannot be calculated
between other language pairs, such as English and Chinese.
The method proposed by Oh et al. used common images as a
feature, which cannot be used across Wiki knowledge bases.
Although both of the two methods train SVM to predict
new cross-lingual links, they did not consider the relations
between predictions.

Recently, many projects based on the cross-lingual links
of Wikipeida have been proposed. DBpedia [6][4] is a knowl-
edge based built by extracting structured information from
Wikipedia. Currently DBpedia has described more than 3.5
million things, and 1.67 million of these things are classi-
ﬁed in a consistent ontology. The DBpedia ontology or-
ganized things into persons, places, music albums, ﬁlms,
video games, organizations, species and diseases. Erdmann
et al. [15] extracted a dictionary from Wikipedia by ana-
lyzing the link structure of Wikipdia.
In addition to the
cross-lingual links, they also explore the redirect page, link
text to extend the coverage of the built dictionary. They
ﬁrst constructed a baseline dictionary by exploring the cross-
lingual links in Wikipedia; and then extracted more trans-
lation candidates from redirect page and link text informa-
tion. MENTA [11] is a multilingual entity taxonomy built
from Wikipedia and WordNet. By aggregating unreliable
taxonomic links between entities from diﬀerent language ver-

Illustration of existing and discovered

We crawled 3,941,659 articles from Baidu Baike, which are
edited by 1,454,204 authors and organized in 599,463 cate-
gories.

There have already been 217,689 cross-lingual links of ar-
ticles and 35,294 cross-lingual links of categories between
English Wikipedia and Chinese Wikipedia. Among those
linked Chinese articles and categories, we have found 96,970
equivalent articles and 10,350 equivalent categories in Baidu
Baike. Therefore, we establish 96,970 initial cross-lingual
links of articles between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike,
and 10,350 initial cross-lingual links of categories between
English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike. Based on our candidate
selection method, we choose 3,082,751 English articles and
963,788 Chinese articles for LFG to discover cross-lingual
links between them. We run LFG on a server with 1.87GHz
CPU (4 cores) and 6 GB memory. It costs 17 hour 32 min-
utes to ﬁnally get 202,141 cross-lingual links between English
Wikipedia and Baidu Baike. Figure 12 shows the relation
of existing and discovered inter-language links between ar-
ticles. Table 3 lists some of these cross-lingual links. There
are generally four types these links, including persons (Per.),
locations (Loc.), organizations (Org.) and scientiﬁc terms
(Ter.). The discovered links are not available in Wikipedia.
By using our approach, the number of cross-lingual links has
been doubled.

6. RELATED WORK

In this section, we review some related work.

6.1 Discovering Missing Cross-lingual Links

in Wikipedia

A group of highly related work is to discover missing cross-
lingual links within Wikipedia. As more and more researches
use the cross-lingual links of Wikipedia to build multilin-
gual lexical resources, the problem of missing cross-lingual
links has attracted increasingly attention. The missing of
cross-lingual links means that there are corresponding arti-
cles within two languages, but there is no direct cross-lingual
link between them. In order to solve this problem and en-
rich the cross-lingual links in Wikipedia, several approach-
es have been proposed. Sorg and Cimiano [31] proposed a
method to ﬁnd missing cross-lingual links between English
and German. Their method makes use of the link struc-
ture of articles to ﬁnd candidates of missing links. And
then a classiﬁer is trained based on several graph-based fea-
tures and text-based features to predict the missing links.
Oh et al. [29] proposed a method for discovering missing

onomy is build. HeiNER [39] is a multilingual Heidelberg
Named Entity Resource, which translates Named Entities
into the various target languages by exploiting cross-lingual
information contained in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.
BabelNet [26] is a large multilingual semantic network built
from Wikipedia and WordNet, which provides concepts and
named entities lexicalized in many languages and connected
with large amounts of semantic relations. Hassan et al. [18]
address the task of cross-lingual semantic relatedness by ex-
ploiting the cross-lingual links available between Wikipedia
versions in multiple languages. Ye et al. [40] proposed a
graph-based approach to constructing a multilingual associ-
ation dictionary from Wikipedia. The extracted association
dictionary is applied in cross language information retrieval.
6.2 Ontology and Instance Matching

Ontology and instance matching is another related prob-
lem. As the development of the Linked Data project [2], on-
tology and instance matching is attracting more and more
interests. The goal of otology and instance matching is to
ﬁnd equivalent elements between two heterogeneous seman-
tic data sources. Currently, most work focus on monolingual
matching tasks, such as Silk [36],idMesh [10],KnoFuss [28].
Some approaches such as SOCOM [17], RiMOM [24][32][41]
and [16] deal with the cross-lingual ontology matching, they
mainly use the machine translation tools to bridge the gap
between languages. Our approach uses only language inde-
pendent features of Wiki articles, which does not need any
translation tools.
6.3 Record linkage

Record linkage is to identify records in the same or diﬀer-
ent databases that refer to the same real-world entity [14].
An record linkage approach typically compares various ﬁelds
of database records, and either matches records based on do-
main knowledge and generic distance metrics, or applies su-
pervised machine learning techniques to learn how to match
the records [21]. Approaches based on supervised learning
techniques include [7][5][8] . Unsupervised record linkage ap-
proaches include [27][38]. Some tools such as TAILOR [13]
have been proposed for record linkage applications. Re-
searches on record linkage try to ﬁnd equivalent objects in
databases, while our approach aims to ﬁnd equivalent arti-
cles across Wiki knowledge bases in two diﬀerent languages.
Although the problem of record linkage has been studied for
decades, few works on cross-lingual record matching have
been proposed.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual knowledge linking
approach for building cross-lingual links across Wiki knowl-
edge bases. Our approach uses only language-independent
features of article, and employs a graph model to predict
new cross-lingual links. Evaluations on existing cross-lingual
links in Wikipedia shows that our approach can achieve high
precision 85.8% with a recall of 88.1%. Using our approach,
we are able to ﬁnd 202,141 new cross-lingual links between
English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike.

Because the number of initial links is relative small based
on the existing cross-lingual links in Wikipedia, we can ﬁnd
only part of new links between Wikipedia and Baidu Baike.
If we add discovered new links to existing links, and use

the merged links as seed, our approach can iteratively dis-
cover new linked articles. Therefore, our future work is to
extending our approach to an iterative one, to ﬁnd more
cross-lingual links.
