ABSTRACT
Online gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry that en-
tertains a large, global population. One unfortunate phe-
nomenon, however, poisons the competition and the fun:
cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported
expenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims’ mon-
etary losses due to cyber crime.

This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an
online social network built on top of the world’s dominant
digital game delivery platform. We collected information
about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global
social network, of which more than 700 thousand have their
proﬁles ﬂagged as cheaters. We also collected in-game in-
teraction data of over 10 thousand players from a popular
multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are well
embedded in the social and interaction networks: their net-
work position is largely indistinguishable from that of fair
players. We observe that the cheating behavior appears to
spread through a social mechanism: the presence and the
number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with
the likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also,
we observe that there is a social penalty involved with being
labeled as a cheater: cheaters are likely to switch to more re-
strictive privacy settings once they are tagged and they lose
more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the
number of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical,
real-world population density, or with the local popularity
of the Steam Community.

munity that facilitates unethical in-game behavior. “Cheats”
are software components that implement game rule viola-
tions, such as seeing through walls or automatically tar-
geting a moving character. It has been recently estimated
that cheat code developers generate between $15, 000 and
$50, 000 per month from one class of cheats for a particular
game alone [3].

In all cultures, players resent the unethical behavior that
breaks the rules of the game: “The rules of a game are ab-
solutely binding [...] As soon as the rules are transgressed,
the whole play-world collapses. The game is over [18]”. On-
line gamers are no diﬀerent judging by anecdotal evidence,
vitriolic comments against cheaters on gaming blogs, and
the resources invested by game developers to contain and
punish cheating (typically through play restrictions). For
some cheaters, the motivation is monetary: virtual goods are
worth real-world money on eBay, and online game economies
provide a lucrative opportunity for cyber criminals [19, 20].
For other cheaters, a competitive advantage and the desire
to win is motivation enough [21].

Cheating is seen by the game development and distribu-
tion industry as both a monetary and a public relations
problem [9] and, consequently, signiﬁcant resources are in-
vested to contain it. For example, Steam, the largest dig-
ital distribution channel for PC games, employs the Valve
Anti-Cheat System (VAC) that detects cheats and marks the
corresponding user’s proﬁle with a permanent, publicly vis-
ible (regardless of privacy setting), red, “ban(s) on record”.
Game servers can be conﬁgured to be VAC-secured and re-
ject players with a VAC-ban on record matching the family
of games that the server supports. The overwhelming major-
ity of servers available in the Steam server browser as of Oc-
tober 2011 are VAC-secured. For example, out of the 4,234
Team Fortress 2 servers available on October 12, 2011, 4,200
were VAC-secured. Of the 34 non-secured servers, 26 were
servers owned and administrated by a competitive gaming
league that operates its own anti-cheat system.

Gaming interactions mimic, to some extent, real-world
interactions [27]. Understanding cheaters’ position in the
social network that connects gamers is relevant not only
for evaluating and reasoning about anti-cheat actions and
policies in gaming environments, but also for studying so-
cial networks at large. Studying cheaters can serve to bet-
ter understand the behavior of individuals that abuse the
shared social space in large-scale non-hierarchical communi-

WWW 2012 – Session: Security and Fraud in Social NetworksApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France81ties. In online social networks, for example, such individuals
abuse available, legal tools, like communication or tagging
features, for marketing gains or political activism. Taken to
the extreme, such behaviors lead to the tragedy of the com-
mons: all game players become cheaters and then abandon
the game, or corruption escalates and chaos ensues.

Like many gaming environments, Steam allows its mem-
bers to declare social relationships and connect themselves
to Steam Community, an online social network. This work
reports on our analysis of the Steam Community social graph
with a particular focus on the position of the cheaters in the
network. To enable this study, we crawled the Steam Com-
munity and collected data for more than 12 million users.
Our analysis targets the position of cheaters in the net-
work, evidences homophily between cheaters, explores the
geo-social characteristics that might diﬀerentiate cheaters
from fair players, and highlights the social consequences of
the publicly visible cheating ﬂag.

Our study shows that cheaters are well embedded in the
social network; they exhibit a high degree of homophily;
their geo-social characteristics diﬀer from those of fair play-
ers; and while the cheating ﬂag does not aﬀect their aggre-
gate well being in the gaming environment, it is penalized
by friendship loss, and marked by some degree of embar-
rassment. Additionally, our temporal analysis of the cheat-
ing data suggests that cheating behavior spreads via a social
mechanism: the presence and the number of cheater friends
of a fair player is correlated with the likelihood of her be-
coming a cheater in the future.

An overview of related work is presented in Section 2.
Our datasets are presented in Section 3, along with our data
collection methodology. Section 4 analyzes the position of
cheaters in the network from the perspective of declared re-
lationships, in-game interactions, and the strength of their
relationships measured via social-geographical metrics.
It
also presents the eﬀect of the VAC-ban on individual players.
Section 5 reasons about possible mechanisms for spreading
the cheating behavior. Section 6 concludes with a summary
of our ﬁndings and their consequences.

2. RELATED WORK

Cheating in social gaming is a relatively unexplored area.
Nazir et al. study fake proﬁles created to gain an advantage
in social gaming contexts in [21]. Through the evaluation
of behavior of player accounts within the social game Fight-
ers’ Club (FC) they are able to predict with high accuracy
whether a proﬁle is fake. Users in FC cheat by creating fake
proﬁles to perform a Sybil attack, whereas cheaters in Steam
Community are not trying to alter the structure of the social
graph. Instead, they attack game rule implementations.

“Gold farmers” are cheaters that make black-market ex-
changes of real world currency for virtual goods outside of
sanctioned, in-game, trade mechanisms. By examining so-
cial networks constructed from database dumps of banned
EverQuest II (EQ2) players, Keegan et al. [19] found gold
farmers exhibit diﬀerent connectivity and assortativity than
both their intermediaries and normal players, and are simi-
lar to real-world drug traﬃcking networks. Ahmad et al. [1]
further examined trade networks of gold farmers and pro-
pose models for deviant behavior prediction.

Their data set diﬀers from ours in both motivation for
cheating, and the method of punishing cheaters. No clear
ﬁnancial motivation for cheating exists in the majority of

games played by Steam Community players. Additionally,
while cheaters in EQ2 have their accounts permanently dis-
abled, cheaters in Steam Community are only restricted
from playing the particular game they were caught cheat-
ing in on VAC-secured servers, as explained in Section 3.

Finally, we note that to the best of our knowledge, our
work is the largest scale study of cheaters in a gaming social
network. We discovered over double the amount of cheaters
as there were players in [21], and multiple orders of magni-
tude more cheaters than players in [19, 1].

Although not much quantitative analysis has been per-
formed, cheating in video games has been studied qualita-
tively. Duh and Chen describe several frameworks for ana-
lyzing cheating, as well as how diﬀerent cheats can impact
online communities in [11]. Dumitrica examines Neopets,
a web based social game in [12]. She describes a process
by which gamers, who naturally seek ways to increase their
“gaming capital”, are tempted to cheat, and argues that a
cheating culture emerges, where social values are used to
understand and evaluate the ethical questions of cheating.

Social networks of online gamers have been addressed in
recent studies. Szell and Thurner [27] provide a detailed
analysis of the social interactions between players in Pardus,
a web-based Massively Multiplayer Online Game. They em-
ploy, as we do in this study, traditional tools from social
network analysis, however, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the datasets used. First, declared relationships between
users in the Steam Community are informed by underlying
in-game interactions, but exist in a more general “gaming”
context than in Pardus, where the social network is built on
interactions within the context of one game. Second, play-
ers in Pardus can declare friends and enemies. In our study,
players can only declare friends. While we do provide some
results based on interaction data from a Team Fortress 2
(TF2) server, TF2 players do not declare friends and foes,
but compete on ad-hoc, opposing teams. Finally, while there
might be cheaters present in the Pardus dataset, they are
not identiﬁed or studied.

Xu et al. [29] interviewed 14 Halo 3 players to study the
meaning of relationships within an online gaming context.
They found evidence of in-game relationships supported by
real-world relationships, triadic closure of relationships mak-
ing use of both real and virtual relationships as a bridge, and
in-game interactions strengthening ties in the real world.
They further found evidence of social control as a tool for
managing deviant behavior. In addition to in-game interac-
tions on a single game server, we also measure and analyze
the social structure of millions of online gamers and their
relationships with the deviant class of users that cheat.

General gaming studies have characterized network traﬃc
due to gaming, resource provisioning, work load prediction,
and player churn in online games [7, 8, 13, 14, 15]. Other
studies have focused on the psychological and social proper-
ties of gamers [16] and gaming communities [6, 28, 10].

3. DATASETS

Steam controls between 50% and 70% of the PC digital
download market [25], and claims over 30 million user ac-
counts as of October 2011. Steam is run by Valve, who also
develops some of the most successful multiplayer ﬁrst-person
shooter (FPS) games.

While games from a number of developers and publishers
are available for purchase on Steam, an important segment

WWW 2012 – Session: Security and Fraud in Social NetworksApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France82is formed by the multiplayer FPS genre. In contrast to mas-
sively multiplayer online games, multiplayer FPSs usually
take place in a relatively “small” environment, player actions
generally do not aﬀect the environment between sessions,
and instead of one logical game world under the control of
a single entity, there are multiple individually-owned and
operated servers. Because there is no central entity control-
ling game play and a very large number of servers to choose
from, the communities that form around individual servers
are essential to the prolonged health of a particular game.

3.1 The Steam Community

Recognizing the social nature of gaming in general, Valve
created the Steam Community. Steam Community is a so-
cial network comprised of Steam users, i.e., people who buy
and play games on Steam. To have a Steam Community
proﬁle, one ﬁrst needs to have a Steam account and take the
additional step of conﬁguring a proﬁle. Users with a Steam
account and no proﬁle (and thus, not part of the Steam Com-
munity) can participate in all gaming activities, and can be
befriended by other Steam users, but no direct information is
available about them. Steam proﬁles are accessible in game
via the Steam client and are also available in a traditional
web based format at http://steamcommunity.com.

Valve also provides the Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) service
that detects players who cheat and marks their proﬁles with
a publicly visible, permanent VAC ban. Server operators
can “VAC-secure” their servers: any player with a VAC ban
for a given game can not play that game on VAC-secured
servers (but they are allowed to play other games). In an
eﬀort to stymie the creators and distributors of cheats and
hacks, the details of how VAC works are not made public.
What is known is that VAC bans are not issued immedi-
ately upon cheat detection, but rather in delayed waves, as
an additional attempt to slow an arms race between cheat
creation and detection.

While Steam accounts are free to create, they are severely
restricted until associated with a veriﬁable identity, for ex-
ample from game purchases (via a credit card) or from a
gift from a veriﬁed account. Once associated with an ac-
count, game licenses (whether bought or received as a gift)
are non-transferable. This serves as a disincentive for users
to abandon ﬂagged accounts for new ones: abandoning an
account means abandoning all game licenses associated with
that account. Moreover, Sybil attacks become infeasible,
as they would require monetary investments and/or a real-
world identity for even the most trivial actions, such as chat-
ting with other players.

3.2 Data Collection

In our analysis we used three data sources. The vast
majority of our data was obtained by crawling the Steam
Community website to collect user proﬁles and the result-
ing social network. In order to augment proﬁle information
with the (approximate) time of VAC bans, we queried the
vacbanned.com site. And ﬁnally, we obtained in-game inter-
actions from a TF2 server located in California.

Crawling the Steam Community: Using unmetered,
consumable XML on the Steam Community web site, we
crawled during March 16th and April 3rd, 2011. The crawler
collected user proﬁles starting from a randomly generated
set of SteamIDs and following the friendship relationships
declared in user proﬁles. To seed our crawler, we generated

100,000 random SteamIDs within the key space (64-bit iden-
tiﬁers with a common preﬁx that reduced the ID space to
less than 109 possible IDs), of which 6,445 matched conﬁg-
ured proﬁles.

The crawling was executed via a distributed breadth ﬁrst
search. Each of the initial seed SteamIDs was pushed onto
an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue. Each crawler
process popped one SteamID oﬀ this queue and retrieved
the corresponding proﬁle data via a modiﬁed version of the
Steam Condenser library. The proﬁle data of the crawled
user was stored in a database and any newly discovered
users (i.e., friends that were previously unseen) were added
to the SQS queue. Crawling proceeded until there were no
items remaining in the queue. Using RightScale, Inc’s cloud
computing management platform to automatically scale the
crawl according to the number of items in the SQS queue,
we ended up running up to six Amazon “c1.medium” EC2
instances executing up to 15 crawler processes each.

A Steam proﬁle includes a nickname, a privacy setting
(public, private, friends only or in-game only), set of friends
(identiﬁed by SteamIDs), group memberships, list of games
owned, gameplay statistics for the past two weeks, a user-
selected geographical location, and a ﬂag (VAC-ban) that in-
dicates whether the corresponding user has been algorithmi-
cally found cheating. We augmented the information for the
VAC-banned players with a timestamp that signiﬁes when
the VAC ban was ﬁrst observed (as explained next).

From our initial 6, 445 seeds of user IDs, we discovered just
about 12.5 million user accounts, of which 10.2 million had
a proﬁle conﬁgured (about 9 million public, 313 thousand
private, and 852 thousand visible to friends only). There are
88.5 million undirected friendship edges and 1.5 million user-
created groups. Of the users with public proﬁles, 4.7 million
had a location set (one of 33,333 pre-deﬁned locations), 3.2
million users with public proﬁles played at least one game
in the two weeks prior to our crawl, and 720 thousand users
are ﬂagged as cheaters. Table 1 gives the exact numbers.

Collecting VAC Ban Timestamps: We collected
historical data on when a cheating ﬂag was ﬁrst observed
from a 3rd party service, vacbanned.com, that allows users
to enter a SteamID into a search box to check whether or not
that SteamID has been banned. If the account is banned,
the date the ban was ﬁrst observed is provided. We also
re-crawled (between October 18th and October 29th 2011)
all Steam proﬁles discovered during the ﬁrst crawl without
a VAC ban, to identify which non-cheaters had been ﬂagged
as cheaters since April 2011. Of these, 43, 465 now have a
VAC ban on record.

Vacbanned.com had observed ban dates for 423,592 of the
cheaters we discovered during our initial crawl. Figure 1
shows a CDF of these ban observations over time. The ear-
liest dates indicate users that were banned prior to Decem-
ber 29th, 2009. We combined the “banned-since” dates from
our original crawl, vacbanned.com, and our re-crawl. In the
case of a user proﬁle having more than one ban date (due
to the 3 sources), the earliest date was chosen.
It is im-
portant to note that all ban dates were treated as “on or
before” as opposed to a precise timestamp. This is because
the ban dates are when the ban was ﬁrst observed by a 3rd
party (vacbanned.com or our crawler), not necessarily when
it was applied by Valve.

In-game interactions: We have acquired detailed game
play logs of a 32-simultaneous player VAC-secured TF2 server

from April 1 to June 8, 2011, and consist of various game-
speciﬁc events involving 10, 354 players. Because this server
is VAC-secured, no players that have cheated in TF2 appear
in the logs; the only cheaters that appear are those that were
caught in a diﬀerent game.

Figure 1: Historical VAC ban dates as reported by
vacbanned.com. The date of discovery is on the x-axis,
and the cumulative probability distribution of the
number of discovered accounts is on the y-axis. The
jump around end of May 2011 is probably due to an
eﬀort from the website to populate their database.

From the server logs we extracted 5 diﬀerent interactions
types between users, and constructed an interaction graph
where an edge exists between two players if they interacted
together during the game. The resulting graph contained
10, 354 users (93 were cheaters) and had 486, 808 edges.

4. CHEATERS AND THEIR FRIENDS

One line of thought in moral philosophy is that (non)ethical
behavior of an individual is heavily inﬂuenced by his social
ties [23]. Under this theory, cheaters should appear tightly
connected to other cheaters in the social network. On the
other hand, unlike in crime gangs [1], cheaters do not need to
cooperate with each other to become more eﬀective. More-
over, playing against other cheaters may not be particularly
attractive. These observations suggest that cheaters may be
dispersed in the network, contradicting the ﬁrst intuition.

To understand the position of cheaters in the social net-
work, we characterize the Steam Community social net-
work over four axes: First, we explore the relationship be-
tween cheating status and the number of friends a user (Sec-
tion 4.1); second, we use the in-game interaction trace to
understand who plays with cheaters (Section 4.2); third, we
try to understand whether cheaters are visibly penalized by
the other members of the social network (Section 4.3); and,
ﬁnally, we explore the relationship between social network
proximity and two other proximity metrics, geographical
and community-based (Section 4.4).
4.1 Who is Friends with Cheaters?

The degree distribution of the Steam Community graph as
a whole, just cheater proﬁles, as well as for private, friends-
only proﬁles, and users without proﬁles are plotted as CCDF
in Figure 2. For users without a proﬁle or private proﬁles,

edges in the graph are inferred based on the information
from public proﬁles that declare the user as a friend. From
the degree distributions we make two observations.

First, we discovered a hard limit of 250 friends. However,
there are some users who have managed to circumvent this
hard limit. One user in particular has nearly 400 friends,
and through manual examination we observed this user’s
degree increasing by one or two friends every few days. Co-
incidentally, this proﬁle also has a VAC ban on record.

Second, all categories plotted in Figure 2, with the excep-
tion of that of users with Steam accounts but no proﬁles,
overlap. We thus make two observations. First, cheaters
have about the same number of declared friends as non-
cheaters. Second, this data highlights that attempting to
hide connection information through private or friends-only
proﬁle privacy settings is unsuccessful: the player’s position
in the social network is revealed by the privacy settings of
his friends.

While cheaters are mostly indistinguishable from fair play-
ers using the node degree distribution, a more important
question is whether their deviant behavior shows network ef-
fects. In other words, are cheaters more likely to be friends
with other cheaters than with non-cheaters? Figure 3(a)
plots the CDF of the fraction of a player’s friends who are
cheaters. Figure 3(b) plots the CCDF of the number of
cheaters friends for both cheaters and non-cheaters. This

WWW 2012 – Session: Security and Fraud in Social NetworksApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France84ﬁgure is comparable to Figure 2(a), but displays only the
“cheating” degree of users.

The picture that emerges from these two ﬁgures is a strik-
ing amount of homophily between cheaters: cheaters are
more likely to be friends with other cheaters. While nearly
70% of non-cheaters have no friends that are cheaters, 70%
of cheaters have at least 10% cheaters as their friends. About
15% of cheaters have over half of their friends other cheaters.
While the diﬀerentiation is visually apparent, we ensured it
is statistically signiﬁcant by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test to verify that the two samples are drawn from
diﬀerent probability distributions (p < 0.01, D = 0.4367,
and p < 0.01, D = 0.3787 at the 5% signiﬁcance level for
Figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively).

of the server as a whole, are likely to have more interactions
with declared friends. Second, we notice that interacting
pairs with at least one cheater in the pair have fewer absolute
interactions than the server as whole.

Figure 4: (a) CCDF of the declared friendship de-
gree and interaction degree of users from a popular
TF2 server. (b) CCDF of the number of interactions
between declared and non-declared pairs of friend
players on a popular TF2 server.

To investigate if the declared friendships reﬂect in-game
interactions and if cheaters have similar playing patterns
with non-cheaters, we studied the 2-month interaction net-
work generated from the TF2 server logs. Figure 4(a) plots
a CCDF of the declared friendship degree as well as the
interaction degree for players appearing in the interaction
network. We ﬁrst note that even on a single server for a sin-
gle game, players generally interact with considerably more
players than they have declared friendships with. However,
the correlation between the number of declared friends and
the number of distinct interaction partners is low (Pearson
coeﬃcient 0.16). This suggests that being popular in the
social network does not necessarily translate to an increase
in unique interaction partners.

Figure 4(b) compares the number of interactions between
declared friends and players who are not declared friends.
The plot suggests that players with a declared friendship in-
teract with each other more often than players without a de-
clared friendship, indicating that Steam Community friend-
ships are representative of in-game interactions.

But, are cheaters ostracized by non-cheaters during game-
play? We answer this question by examining how cheaters
interact with declared and non-declared friends. Figure 5
plots the CCDF of the number of pairwise interactions, with
at least one member of the pair being a cheater (or non-
cheater), for both declared and non-declared Steam Com-
munity friendships.

There are two important observations that result from
these plots. First, we see that cheaters, like the population

Unique gameplay friends

Unique gameplay foes

Figure 6: CCDF of the number unique gameplay
friends and foes of cheaters and non-cheaters.

Since TF2 games are between competing teams, play-
ers on the same team can have cooperative interactions,
and those on opposing teams can have antagonistic inter-
actions. If players had overwhelmingly negative feelings to-
wards cheaters, one might expect cheaters to be involved
in fewer cooperative interactions than antagonistic interac-
tions, i.e., players might target those with a cheating ﬂag
in a form of vigilante justice. This does not seem to be
the case as demonstrated by Figure 6, which presents the
CCDF of number of unique “friend” (cooperative) and “foe”
(antagonistic) partners for cheaters and non-cheaters. While
cheaters tend to have slightly fewer unique gameplay part-
ners than non-cheaters, the diﬀerence is negligible (the KS
test was unable to reject the null hypothesis with p = 0.7498,
and p = 0.7602 respectively), indicating that the cheater/non-
cheater status of a player does not hold much weight during
active game play. There are several explanations for this
ﬁnding. First, it is possible that the perception of a general
distaste for cheaters is only the eﬀect of a vocal minority.
Second, the lack of a visible in-game cheater brand allows
cheaters to blend in with the rest of the players. Finally,
gamers might be tolerant of cheaters as long as they are not
actively displaying cheating behavior.
4.3 Are Cheaters in Disgrace?

While aggregate-level information shows little diﬀerenti-
ation between cheaters and non-cheaters, the eﬀect of the
VAC-ban mark can better be understood by analyzing the
transition from non-cheater to cheater. We answer the fol-
lowing two questions: 1) Are cheaters shamed by the mark

WWW 2012 – Session: Security and Fraud in Social NetworksApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France85on their permanent record? and 2) Does the community
shun cheaters once their transgressions are revealed?

Of the new cheaters discovered from our re-crawl, 87%
had no change in privacy state, and nearly 10% changed
their privacy setting from public to a more restrictive set-
ting. In comparison, in our control group of re-crawled non-
cheaters, privacy settings remained unchanged for over 97%
of users, and less than 3% changed to a more restrictive set-
ting. Cheaters seem to value their privacy more once their
sins are laid bare, perhaps in the naive hope that a more
restrictive setting will provide a measure of protection from
a potentially disapproving community.

Net change in neighborhood size

Figure 7: CDF of net change in cheaters’ and non-
cheaters’ neighborhood size.

But is the community disapproving? Figure 7 plots the
CDF of net change in the number of friends for cheaters
and non-cheaters during the six months between our two
crawls. Of the still public cheaters in our re-crawl, 44% had
a net loss of friends, 13% had a net gain, and 43% had no
change. Of the non-cheaters in our new crawl, 25% had a
net loss of friends, 36% had a net gain, and 39% had no
change. While both sets of users exhibited ﬂuctuations in
the size of their neighborhoods, more cheaters lost friends
and fewer cheaters gained friends when compared to non-
cheaters. Treated as a whole, cheaters lost nearly twice as
many friends as they gained, and non-cheaters gained twice
as many friends as they lost. Overall, non-cheaters continue
to gain friends, and cheaters, while not overtly ostracized,
appear to have trouble making new friends and may lose a
few of their previous ones.

There are several possible explanations for the changes in
neighborhood sizes we observe. First, evidence suggests that
online gamers “clean up” their friend lists to make room for
new friends, removing people they no longer play with [29].
However, because so few users are near the 250 friend limit
(as seen in Figure 2(a)), we do not believe this is the pri-
mary contributing factor to neighborhood size ﬂuctuations.
A second explanation is that the Steam client, by default,
issues “pop up” notiﬁcations that are visible in game when-
ever a friend starts playing any game. If a gamer has many
active friends, these pop ups might become distracting, pos-
sibly prompting a purge of friends they no long actively play
with regardless of how close they are to the friend limit. A
ﬁnal explanation, especially with respect to the net loss of
friends cheaters suﬀer, is that cheaters are deliberately sev-
ering their ties once they are caught cheating. We observed
one account in particular that went from 200 to 0 friends af-
ter the VAC ban was issued. “Social suicide” might account
for large decreases in degree, as it is far more probable that

the cheater himself deletes friends, rather than each of his
friends deleting the cheater.
4.4 Are Cheaters Close?

We use two metrics, one geographical, and another social,
to quantify the strength of the relationship between Steam
Community users.

Geographical proximity: Exploring the relationship
between geographical and social-network proximity may give
quantitative support to the theory proposed in [12] accord-
ing to which opinions on cheating are culturally derived.
Although framed mainly in the context of a speciﬁc set of
game rules, we extend the theory into the real world by ﬁrst
observing that user population on Steam Community does
not follow real-world geographic population and, more im-
portantly, cheaters are not uniformly distributed. Figure 8
shows Steam Community populations for the twelve coun-
tries comprising the union of the top ten user populations
and the top ten cheater populations. The ﬁgure shows that
cheaters are vastly overrepresented in some locations:
for
example, there are about 55,000 cheaters in the Nordic Eu-
ropean countries (12.4% of the playing population of the
region), while there are about 39,000 cheaters (3.9%) in the
US. In particular, we found enough Steam proﬁles to account
for nearly 2.5% of Denmark’s 5.5 million residents, of which
cheaters account for nearly 0.5% of Denmark’s population.

normalized to real world population of that country.
The countries are sorted on the x-axis in decreasing
order of their real-world populations.

We now ask two additional questions: 1) Does the Steam
Community exhibit properties of a location-based social net-
work? and 2) Do cheaters tend to form geographically closer
relationships with other cheaters than non-cheaters? To an-
swer these, we measure node locality, a geo-social metric
introduced in [24]. The node locality of a given node quan-
tiﬁes how close (geographically) it is to all of its neighbors
in the social graph. Thus, a node locality of 1 indicates that
a given node is at least as close to all of its neighbors as any
other node in the graph is to their neighbors, and a value
of 0 indicates that a given node is further away from all its
neighbors than any other node in the graph.

We constructed the location network by including an edge
from the social network if and only if both end points had a
known location. This lead to a reduction in the size of the
network, which, along with the geo-social properties of the
resulting location network, can be seen in Table 2. We note
that a subgraph composed solely of cheater-to-cheater re-
lationships (C-C) has a lower mean distance between nodes
and average link length than the location network as a whole.

network (Steam Community), the cheater-to-cheater sub-

graph (C-C), as well as just the cheaters within the location
network (Cheaters Only). We ﬁrst note that about 40% of
users in the location network have a node locality of above
0.9, a phenomena exhibited by other geographic online so-
cial networks such as BrightKite and FourSquare [24]. This
is strong evidence that Steam Community relationships ex-
hibit geo-social properties, a characteristic to be expected in
the context of multiplayer gaming where high network laten-
cies cannot be well masked by current game infrastructure.
Next, we observe that the cheater-to-cheater network and
the Steam Community at large have similar node locality
distributions. Finally, when considering only the cheaters
embedded within the location network, we see drastically
lower node locality, with only about 10% of cheaters having
a node locality greater than 0.9.

These results lead to three observations: 1) friendships
tend to form between geographically close users, 2) cheaters
tend to form relationships with other nearby cheaters and
these links are geographically closer than those formed by
non-cheaters, and 3) as evidenced by their lower node lo-
cality when considering the entire location network and not
only the cheater-to-cheater subgraph, cheaters appear to be-
friend geographically remote fair players. This might in-
dicate that cheaters form relationships with other cheaters
via a diﬀerent mechanism than they form relationships with
non-cheaters. Cheater-to-cheater relationships appear geo-
graphically constrained, while their relationships with non-
cheaters are over larger distances.

Social proximity: We use social proximity as the sec-
ond metric to characterize the strength of the relationships
between Steam Community users and understand whether
they materially diﬀer for the cheater population. The social
proximity metric is based on a previous study [22] that sug-
gests that the overlap between the social neighborhood of
two individuals is a good indicator of the strength of their
relationship. We study the overlap of friends of users in the
Steam Community networks to understand whether cheaters
exhibit a stronger relationship with other cheaters than fair
players do with fair players. We assess the strength of the
relationship between two connected users by the overlap be-

tween their sets of friends, computed as follows:

Overlapuv = muv/((ku − 1) + (kv − 1) − muv)

where muv is the number of common neighbors between
users u and v, ku is the number of neighbors of user u and
kv is the number of neighbors of user v. This overlap is cal-
culated for two groups of user pairs: the 1.5 million pairs
of cheaters (i.e., all cheater pairs in the full social network)
and 1.5 million randomly selected pairs of non-cheaters (i.e.,
about 2% of the existing non-cheater pairs). Additionally,
we also calculate the same metric on the cheater-only as well
as on the non-cheater-only graphs.

Figure 10 shows a higher overlap for cheater pairs in the
cheater-only graph and non-cheater pairs in the non-cheater-
only graph compared to the respective overlaps in the overall
social network. This suggests that social relationships are
weaker between diﬀerent types of players (cheaters to non-
cheaters) than within a uniform group.

5. PROPAGATION OF CHEATING

How does cheating behavior spread in the Steam Com-
munity? A ﬁrst insight can be obtained by investigating
how cheating bans propagate in the network over time (Sec-
tion 5.1). Further insight can be obtained by understanding
whether cheaters hold positions of inﬂuence in the social
network (Section 5.2).
5.1 How Does Cheating Propagate over Time?
Based on the observations from Figure 3, we hypothe-
size that the friends of known cheaters are at risk of be-
coming cheaters themselves. To test this hypothesis, we
explored whether cheaters discovered during a given time
interval were more likely to be friends of previously discov-
ered cheaters than to be friends with non-cheaters. Again,
we stress that banned dates must be treated as “on or before”

as opposed to exact timestamps. To mitigate the eﬀects of
this uncertainty, we chose to examine cheaters discovered
over 180-day long intervals.

We begin by assuming that all users in the Steam Commu-
nity friendship network are non-cheaters. We then initialize
the network by marking the 94,522 users found to have a
VAC ban on or before December 29, 2009 (i.e., the earliest
date retrieved from vacbanned.com). For the ﬁrst 180-day
interval (between December 30, 2009 and June 28, 2010),
34,681 players were found to have a VAC ban. For these
users, we calculated and plotted the number and fraction
of their cheater friends (i.e., from the 94,522 cheaters found
previously). We repeat these steps for another 3 time in-
tervals, with 19,294, 571,975, and 43,465 cheaters found in
each. The third interval (starting at December 26, 2010)
contains the bulk of cheaters, since their VAC ban was ﬁrst
observed by our initial crawl (and not from vacbanned.com).
However, as shown next, the diﬀerentiation between cheaters
and non-cheaters holds true for all intervals. In addition to
a best eﬀort approximation of the timestamp of the VAC
bans, the data constructed this way has another caveat: the
social network is from our March/April 2011 crawl, but we
show in Section 4.3 that the network is quite dynamic. We
veriﬁed that despite the change in number of friends over
time, the trend is preserved: we recalculated the fraction
of cheaters in the 1 hop neighborhoods of users based on
the state of their relationships as determined by our Octo-
ber 2011 re-crawl and we found the non-cheaters CDF to
dominate the cheaters CDF as in Figure 3(a).

Figure 11 plots the results of our experiments. Each sub-
plot represents only the cheaters discovered during the cor-

responding time interval, and an equal number of randomly
sampled non-cheaters (statistical signiﬁcance conﬁrmed by
KS test at 5% signiﬁcance level, p < 0.01 in all cases, and
D = 0.215, 0.2172, 0.1963, and 0.2911 for the fraction of
cheater friends distributions of each interval, respectively).
From the plots we see evidence that users with both a higher
absolute number of cheater friends, as well as those with pro-
portionally more cheater friends are more likely to become
cheaters themselves.

To understand if the number of cheater friends has any
predictive power on the state of a player, we used the frame-
work developed by Backstrom et al. [5]. We ﬁrst created a
dataset of fair players with at least one cheater friend at the
time of our ﬁrst crawl. We then labeled the players from this
set who were marked as cheaters by the time of our second
crawl. We consider the new cheaters as joining a group in
the sense of the Backstrom study to estimate the probability
of a fair player becoming a cheater. We then applied the de-
cision tree technique, using the number of cheater friends as
the single feature, and achieved a ROCA of .61. With per-
fect knowledge, that is, if every single cheater was marked
in our dataset by a perfect and timely cheating detection
system, we would expect this value to be higher. (In com-
parison, Backstrom et al. show a ROCA value of .6456 for
the DBLP communities and .69244 for LiveJournal.)

While these results show that the number of cheater friends
has predictive power for the transition of a player from fair
to cheater, it is diﬃcult to ascertain the speciﬁcs of how the
behavior propagates. Speciﬁcally, it is diﬃcult to distinguish
between homophily and contagion by simply observing the
network properties and without strong assumptions about

WWW 2012 – Session: Security and Fraud in Social NetworksApril 16–20, 2012, Lyon, France88the social process [4, 26]. However, an individual’s propen-
sity towards unethical behavior, and cheating in particular,
has been shown to be dependent on social norms, including
the saliency of the behavior, and whether or not the behav-
ior is observed from in- or out-group members [17]. Our
large-scale ﬁndings further corroborate this theory and sug-
gest that cheating behavior is not preponderantly dependent
on a personal strategy that takes into account player-local
information only, but spreads through a contagion process.
5.2 Are Cheaters in Positions of Inﬂuence?

The position of a node in the social network aﬀects the
potential inﬂuence the node has on close or even remote
parts of the network. For example, a high degree centrality
node—one with many direct neighbors—can directly inﬂu-
ence more nodes than a low degree centrality node. High
betweenness centrality nodes, on the other hand, mediate
the traﬃc along the shortest paths between many pairs of
nodes, thus having inﬂuence on remote parts of the net-
work. A high betweenness centrality cheater, for example,
could facilitate the propagation of cheats and other deviant
behavior to distant parts of the gamers network.

To understand the relative importance of cheaters in the
network, we study their potential for inﬂuence in the Steam
Community by computing their degree centrality and node
betweenness centrality. The degree centrality is simply the
degree of the node in the network, and is thus a local metric.
Betweenness centrality, however, is a global graph measure
and consequently computationally expensive, requiring the
calculation of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in
the network. Due to the scale of our graph, we approximate
betweenness centrality using κ–path centrality, a between-
ness approximation method proposed in [2].

We observe a high correlation of 0.9731 between degree
and betweenness centrality scores of the gamers. This high
correlation remains consistent when we diﬀerentiate on the
player type: 0.9817 for cheaters, and 0.9726 for non-cheaters.
Consequently, if a player has many friends in the Steam
Community network, (that is, high degree centrality), not
only can she inﬂuence many players directly, but she can
also mediate the information ﬂow between remote players
due to her likely high betweenness centrality.

We focus only on the most central players in the network
and study how many of them are cheaters. Table 3 demon-
strates that cheaters are under-represented among the most
central players, despite the fact that they have about the
same degree distribution as the fair players, as shown earlier
in Figure 2(a). Over 7% of the entire player population in
our dataset are cheaters, but they make up less than 7%
of the top 1% most central players, and are not adequately
represented until we consider the top 5% to top 10% most
central players. Earlier results from Section 4.3 could pro-
vide an explanation for this. There seems to be social mech-
anisms that retard the growth of cheaters’ social neighbor-
hoods which could be preventing them from entering the top
1% central players in the social network.

6. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Online gaming has recently become the largest revenue-
generating segment of the entertainment industry, with mil-
lions of geographically dispersed players engaging each other
within the conﬁnes of virtual worlds. An ethical system is
created along with the rules that govern the games. Just

like in the real world, some players make the decision to cir-
cumvent the established rules to gain an unfair advantage,
a practice actively discouraged by the industry and frowned
upon by gamers themselves. This paper examined charac-
teristics of these unethical actors in a large online gaming
social network.

Due to the scale of our dataset, the majority of our com-
putations used the MapReduce framework via the python
mrjob interface for Hadoop on Amazon Elastic MapReduce.
Our MapReduce stages involved graph pre-processing, game-
play statistics computations, geographical data processing,
computing degree distributions, intersections of sets, and
geo-social metrics. Each solution included several MapRe-
duce pipelines (chains of map tasks and reduce tasks) of
smaller subtasks.

At a high level, viewed from the perspective of global net-
work metrics, cheaters are well embedded in the social net-
work, largely indistinguishable from fair players. This is not
entirely unexpected. Cheaters are still gamers, and even
though they are permanently marked, they remain mem-
bers of the community. We observed evidence of this by ex-
amining both the social network and interaction logs from a
multiplayer gaming server, where cheaters were not targeted
or treated overly diﬀerent from non-cheaters.

However, when we examine the transition from fair player
to cheater, we observe the eﬀects of the cheating brand.
First, cheating behavior appears to spread through a social
mechanism, where the presence and the number of cheater
friends of a fair player is correlated with the likelihood of her
becoming a cheater in the future. Consequently, cheaters
end up having more cheater friends than the non-cheaters
have. Second, we observed that cheaters are likely to switch
to more restrictive privacy settings once they are caught, a
sign that they might be uncomfortable with the VAC ban.
Finally, we found that cheaters lose friends over time com-
pared to non-cheaters, an indication that there is a social
penalty involved with cheating.

Cheater distribution does not follow geographical, real-
world population density. The fact that some regions have
higher percentages of cheaters to the player population sug-
gests that cheating behavior may be related to diﬀerences
between speciﬁc geo-social cultures. Such cheating-prone
communities might be the target of more scrutiny, or the
result of higher tolerance to cheating behavior, both in the
legislature and in the gaming population.

Our study has consequences for gaming in particular, but
also for other online social networks with unethical mem-
bers. In the case of gaming, individual servers can evaluate
the cheating risk of a new player by looking at a combi-
nation of attributes inferred from the player’s proﬁle that
include structural features. In the case of general online so-
cial networks, the ﬁndings of our study can be used to better
understand the eﬀects of countermeasures to deal with anti-
social behavior. For example, the proﬁles of users who abuse

personal marketing, or who appear to automate their ac-
tions could be publicly tagged. Our study gives a prelimi-
nary indication that, over time, the reaction of fair users to
such information will make it harder to beneﬁt from forms
of anti-social behaviors that attempt to harness network ef-
fects. The fair users tend to have a vested interest in main-
taining the quality of the shared social space and will limit
the connectivity of the abusing proﬁles.
