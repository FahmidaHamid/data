Programme Chairs’ Welcome 

 

It  is  our  great  pleasure  to  present  you  the  technical  programme  of 
WWW 2012.  

The call for papers attracted a breath-taking number of 885 full paper 
submissions.  521  PC  members  and  235  supporting  reviewers 
evaluated these papers. Based on 3247 reviews and meta-reviews as 
well as many discussions held online, the 27 track chairs and deputy 
chairs  met  with  us  for  two  full  days  in  order  to  discuss  and  decide 
upon  final  acceptance  of  full  papers.  In  the  end,  108 papers  –  only 
12%  of  the  submissions  –  could  be  accommodated  in  the  technical 
programme. 

These papers represent a well-balanced mix over the 13 tracks listed in the call for papers. Though 
the different tracks received very different numbers of submissions, our principal selection criterion 
was quality; hence, we neither enforced a proportional share of acceptances among the tracks nor did 
we favor tracks with lower numbers of submissions. The corresponding submission and acceptance 
numbers per track are given as follows: 

Track
Web Search
Web Mining
Information Extraction and Natural Language

Behavioral Analysis and Personalization
Social Networks
Data and Content Management
Semantic Web
Security, Privacy, Trust, and Abuse

We hope that you will find the resulting program interesting and thought-provoking and that the 
conference will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and 
practitioners from institutions around the world.
