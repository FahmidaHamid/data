ABSTRACT
Most online service providers oﬀer free services to users and
in part, these services collect and monetize personally iden-
tiﬁable information (PII), primarily via targeted advertise-
ments. Against this backdrop of economic exploitation of
PII, it is vital to understand the value that users put to
their own PII. Although studies have tried to discover how
users value their privacy, little is known about how users
value their PII while browsing, or the exploitation of their
PII. Extracting valuations of PII from users is non-trivial –
surveys cannot be relied on as they do not gather informa-
tion of the context where PII is being released, thus reducing
validity of answers. In this work, we rely on reﬁned Experi-
ence Sampling – a data collection method that probes users
to valuate their PII at the time and place where it was gen-
erated in order to minimize retrospective recall and hence
increase measurement validity. For obtaining an honest val-
uation of PII, we use a reverse second price auction. We
developed a web browser plugin and had 168 users – living
in Spain – install and use this plugin for 2 weeks in order to
extract valuations of PII in diﬀerent contexts.
We found that users value items of their online browsing
history for about e 7 (∼ 10 USD), and they give higher val-
uations to their oﬄine PII, such as age and address (about
e 25 or ∼ 36 USD). When it comes to PII shared in speciﬁc
online services, users value information pertaining to ﬁnan-
cial transactions and social network interactions more than
activities like search and shopping. No signiﬁcant distinc-
tion was found between valuations of diﬀerent quantities of
PII (e.g. one vs. 10 search keywords), but deviation was
found between types of PII (e.g. photos vs. keywords). Fi-
nally, the users’ preferred goods for exchanging their PII
included money and improvements in service, followed by
getting more free services and targeted advertisements.

INTRODUCTION

A large part of the Internet economy operates by being re-
liant on online advertisements. In recent years, targeted ad-
vertising has become an attractive oﬀering where targeting
is facilitated by the collection of large amounts of person-
ally identiﬁable information (PII) of end-users. However,
this collection comes at the cost of erosion of privacy of
end-users. Web service providers are collecting more PII
about the end-users, often outside the scope of their appli-
cation (e.g., search engines collecting browsing information
via third party aggregators like Doubleclick etc. [36]). At
the same time, users are becoming more aware of various
privacy breaches [4, 38, 42], attracting the attention of reg-
ulatory bodies [41].

The economics of the online ecosystem can be summed up
by the pithy adage ‘if you are not the consumer, then you are
the product’, more speciﬁcally, the product being end-users’
PII. In such an arrangement, it is easy for service providers
to attach a value on each users’ PII, based on the revenues
they can extract. However, for users to perform a cost-
beneﬁt analysis, where the cost is loss of privacy, and the
beneﬁt is the service they obtain in return, it is important
that they ﬁrst know the value of their PII they are trading
away.

There has been a lot of work on users valuating their in-
formation [9, 10, 18], and in general users’ perceptions about
privacy [2, 3, 14]. However, there has been surprisingly lit-
tle to no work on valuating web-browsing information, even
though it is known that privacy leakages can occur while
web-browsing [26, 36].
In this paper, we focus on under-
standing the value that users attach to their own PII,1 while
web-browsing.

It is challenging to extract the value that users’ put on
their own PII. The valuation could change based on context.

1We focus on monetary value assigned by the user to their
information, although one can imagine other notions of value
and utility like satisfaction etc. We consider money as we
are interested in the overall ecosystem of online services that
partly hinges on monetizing PII. Secondly, money is a tan-
gible concept and easier to arrive at as opposed to user hap-
piness. We will consider other notions of value in future
work.

189For instance, the value that a user puts on the fact that she
is searching for a restaurant can be diﬀerent than when she is
searching for cancer drugs. Even using the same keywords
while searching, but in a diﬀerent context, could lead to
diﬀerent valuations of the same PII (e.g. searching for leisure
while at home or at work). Past work done in this domain
has included valuating personal information (e.g., weight,
age [18]) as well as location information [10]. However they
all rely on surveys that do not leverage contextual factors
when the PII was generated and/or released.

In order to leverage these contextual factors, we rely on
the reﬁned Experience Sampling methodology (rESM) [7]
(Sec. 3.1.1). This data collection approach probes users at
appropriate times to obtain more reliable answers, as ques-
tions are presented to users in-context and hence minimizes
retrospective recall and possible errors that come with such
recall. We implemented rESM by means of a browser plugin
(Secs. (3.3, 3.1.2)). Users get asked speciﬁc questions when
they access diﬀerent types of content/services (social net-
works, search engines, ﬁnance sites, etc.). We recruited 168
participants living in Spain with a diverse range of demo-
graphics (Sec. 3.2), and had them participate in our study
for 2 weeks. We used a reverse second price auction to obtain
an honest valuation for diﬀerent types of PII (Sec. 3.1.4).
We also use our methodology to obtain users’ perceptions
and awareness of the economic usage of their PII by online
service providers (Sec. 4.2).

The major ﬁndings of this work are:

• Users value PII related to their oﬄine identity (age,
gender, address, economic status) at about e 25 (∼
36 USD), and this value does not change when the user
is probed in diﬀerent contexts (e.g. browsing search
sites, webmail, etc.).

• Moreover, users value PII related to oﬄine identity
higher than PII related to browsing activity, which is
about e 7 (∼ 10 USD)2.

• In terms of valuating service speciﬁc PII (e.g. photos
uploaded to social networks, search keywords, online
purchases, etc.), users gave higher valuations to inter-
actions in online social networks (e 12 or ∼ 17 USD)
and ﬁnance web-sites (e 15.5 or ∼ 22 USD), when com-
pared to activities like search (e 2 or ∼ 3 USD) and
shopping (e 5 or ∼ 7 USD).

• The majority of participants in our study were aware
that their PII is being collected when web-browsing,
and while they were positive about their PII being used
to improve services, they were also negative that it
could be monetized by service providers.

• Our results reveal that users prefer to trade their PII
for monetary rewards or improved services more than
trading it for additional free services or targeted ad-
vertisements.

2. RESEARCH CHALLENGES

The work presented herein aims at answering the following

two research questions:

2Equivalent to a Big Mac meal in Spain, circa 2011. Hence
the title of this paper.

• RQ1: What monetary value do users assign to diﬀer-

ent types of PII3 while being online?

• RQ2: What are the perceptions of users vis-a-vis their
PII being monetized, improving existing services and
for personalized advertisements?

In order to answer these questions, it is of great impor-
tance to consider a user-centric approach. Previous work
addressed related questions and using techniques such as
post-study surveys and diaries [6, 30]. These traditional
methods could have drawbacks when trying to gather an-
swers for the questions posed above. For instance, consider
a web user Alice who browses the web on a daily basis. On
a given day, Alice searches for symptoms pertaining to an
illness she suspects she has. Alice then sends an email to
her friend Bob about this illness. Some time later, she takes
part in a traditional survey and/or diary study that aims
at answering the aforementioned research questions. These
techniques would most likely not collect accurate responses
due to a number of reasons, including:

1. Retrospective recall: Self-report recall surveys and di-
aries suﬀer from recall and selective reporting biases [20,
8]. Alice may not be able to remember what she
searched for some time ago, or what emails she ex-
changed. The greater the time that has passed since
these actions occurred, the harder it is for Alice to re-
member and report them accurately in a survey/diary
study.

2. Validity: Alice’s valuation of the illness related key-
words also depends on the context when she shares
her PII (e.g. how, where and when she came up with
the keywords in the ﬁrst place). So even if Alice is later
given keywords related to illness and asked to valuate,
she might not remember or recreate the conditions she
had when she came up with the keywords and may end
up assiging an incorrect value to them.

3. Burden: Alice can be asked to note down her activities
and assign values to diﬀerent PII in a diary. This is
however burdensome for Alice, who might even con-
sider dropping out of the study.

4. Honesty: If Alice needs to valuate several diﬀerent PII
in a long survey or in a daily diary study, she can get
disengaged and provide random values just for the sake
of getting the job done.

5. Engagement: In order to address response fatigue and
have Alice valuate information under a diverse set of
conditions as accurately as possible, we need her to be
motivated. Answering multiple survey questions could
lead to a signiﬁcant number of drop-outs if the study
does not include an element of engagement.

Next, we present the methodology of our study describing
how we tackled these challenges towards providing trustful
results for our research questions.

3A strict deﬁnition of PII does not include browsing behav-
ior. However it has been shown that information leaked on
the web via browsing can be combined to form PII [27], so
we use PII to refer to all the information that a user can
leave online, knowingly or unknowingly.

1903. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Tackling Challenges
3.1.1 Users’ Need for Recall
In order to address the challenge of users’ retrospective re-
call for PII valuation, we use a reﬁned version of the Expe-
rience Sampling Method (rESM). Experience Sampling in-
volves asking participants to report on their experiences at
speciﬁc points throughout the day. The method was origi-
nally developed in the psychology domain [5] and recently
adapted successfully in many studies of Human-Computer
Interaction [8, 19, 20, 29]. As Cherubini et al. highlighted [7],
the main advantage of ESM is its ability to preserve the
ecological validity of the measurements, deﬁned by Hor-
muth et al. as “the occurrence and distribution of stimulus
variables in the natural or customary habitat of an indi-
vidual” [17]. This method is better than recall-based self-
reporting techniques by “probing” the participant in close
temporal proximity to when a relevant event was produced.
One of the drawbacks of the method is that participants
often are sampled at random times and therefore the prob-
ing might be invasive for many participants. This is why
in recent years some researchers have proposed to reﬁne the
method by modeling the participants’ context [7, 12], and
this is what we use.
3.1.2 Validity of PII Valuations
As a means to perform rESM and further address the
challenge of validity of valuations, we instrumented the web
browser of participants with a plugin that was able to log
the website they were browsing and probe them at the exact
time a certain PII was being shared online. At a high level,
the study operated as follows. First, participants installed
the plugin and browsed as usual. Then the plugin would cat-
egorize every website the user would browse into one of the
eight categories: Email, Entertainment, Finance, News,
Search, Shopping, Social, and Health. These categories
closely correspond to the eight popular categories that on-
line ad-networks like Doubleclick4 use, as we are interested
in the monetary aspect of PII. In addition, the plugin was
able to sense when the user was changing context and use
this information to trigger a popup, which would have two
goals: (i) collect the user’s valuation of speciﬁc PII related
to the category of the site the user is browsing, via an auc-
tion and (ii) inquire the user about perceptions of PII usage.
Finally, the popup would send this data to a remote server
for data analysis.
3.1.3 Engagement and User’s Burden
With respect to preventing the user’s burden, we adjusted
the frequency of the popups triggered by the browser plugin
and also allowed users to skip them if they wanted to. In
order to provide users with an element of engagement to
participate actively in the study, we created a real setting
where participants could trade their PII for money based on
their own valuations. More speciﬁcally, participants received
the winning monetary value of every auction they won.

4Doubleclick has more than eight major categories and more
than 600 subcategories. We chose eight as a good trade-oﬀ
between obtaining detailed information without annoying
the user, given that the rESM probing would increase lin-
early with the number of categories.

3.1.4 Honest PII Valuations
In order to persuade participants to provide an honest
valuation of their PII, we relied on a reverse second price
auction: given a set of k bids, pick the lowest bidder as the
winner, and pay that person the amount equivalent to the
second lowest bid. We chose this auction mechanism for the
following reasons: (i) this mechanism has the strong prop-
erty of being truth telling; the best strategy for participants
in the auction is to be honest about their valuation [24],
(ii) it has been used before for valuating location informa-
tion [10], and (iii) it is relatively easy to explain.

We allowed positive amounts, including 0, with increments
of one cent. We also gave the user a choice to not partici-
pate in the auctions at all. This was necessary to cover cases
where users felt overwhelmed with participation and cases
where users did not even want to disclose the fact that their
PII was worth a very high amount. In order to reinforce the
notion that the user would indeed part with their PII if they
won, we had the user verify that they understood their data
would be sold in a second popup. We ran an auction when-
ever we had 20 bids per category from 20 diﬀerent users.
We considered this amount of bids to provide an adequate
tradeoﬀ between a lower bound on the number of partici-
pants to create competitiveness and an upper bound on the
number of participants bids that would be feasible to obtain
within a reasonable amount of time. Multiple auctions were
run during the study.

All winners of the auctions were notiﬁed by email with
information including their winning bid, contextual infor-
mation of the bid (date and time of bid, PII, website they
were on). We reinforced the message that as they won, we
would use their PII (showing the exact PII they bid on),
for a period of 6 months. Likewise, we sent a similar email
to the remainder participants, conveying that as they lost
the bid, their PII would not be used. Only after the end of
the study we informed participants that their PII was actu-
ally not going to be used for any commercial purposes. For
all our communication with users, we used neutral language
with regards to privacy, so as to not prime them one way or
another, following the ﬁndings in Braunstein et al. [6].
3.2 Participants

Participants were recruited using a survey published via
a major Web portal in Spain, that attracts a very diverse
set of users. A total of 168 participants (93 male, 55%)
installed the Firefox browser plugin and completed all re-
quirements of the study. All participants were users of the
Firefox browser and hence had it installed on their com-
puter. Participants’ age ranged between 18 and 58 years
old (¯x = 31.83, s = 8.15). With respect to their educa-
tional level, 1% did not ﬁnish primary school, 8% ﬁnished
primary school, 14% did secondary school, 75% had a uni-
versity graduate degree, and 2% a post-graduate degree. So-
cioeconomic status was also diverse: 28% of the sample said
their annual gross salary to be lower than e 10K, 25% said
it was between e 10K and 20K, for 22% it was in the range
of e 20K and 30K, 11% between e 30K and 40K, and 10%
reported earning more than e 40K per year (4% preferred
not answering this question). All participants lived in Spain
and the vast majority were of Spanish nationality (94%).
Each participant was given a gift card voucher worth e 10
(∼ 14 USD) for taking part in the whole study. Our ethical
board and legal department approved the experiment. Par-

191ticipants were debriefed about what was being logged and
instructed on how to temporarily disable or remove the plu-
gin. Participants were free to leave the experiment at any
time.
3.3 Apparatus: Browser plugin

In order to capture the browsing context of the users we
developed a system consisting of two parts: a browser plugin
– to be installed in participants’ browsers – and a web server
that communicated with the plugin, sending conﬁguration
information and receiving data from it.

Firefox Plugin: The plugin had three main tasks. First,
it captured and stored all browsing activity of the user. This
consisted of the url, time of page access, and a unique ID we
assigned to each browser. This data was stored on the local
machine and sent to the server at regular intervals.

The second main task of the plugin was to categorize vis-
ited websites into one of the eight categories mentioned in
Sec. 3.1.2. In order to do this, we relied on a hard-coded
list of 1184 popular sites from diﬀerent categories for Spain,
gleaned from alexa.com. Although some popular sites like
Facebook can host content pertaining to health or enter-
tainment, we hard-coded it to Social.5 For sites that were
not on Alexa, we resolved them into categories in real-time
by relying on an approach implemented in another browser
plugin called Adnostic [40]. The basic idea is to perform a
cosine similarity between the set of keywords present on the
site the user visits and a massive corpus of words that are
associated with speciﬁc categories. The category with the
highest similarity score is used and the appropriate text is
presented in the pop-up. Testing on individual unclassiﬁed
and Alexa-classiﬁed websites gave a high level of accuracy
(approx. 98% correct classiﬁcation).

Third, the plugin presented the participants with two in-
dependent popups, as described earlier. The ﬁrst popup dis-
played auction questions and the other displayed questions
related to exploitation of PII. These were conﬁgured to be
switched on or oﬀ from the server. From a UI perspective,
the popup displayed the text of relevant auction question,
with the type of PII in the auction in bold text, to highlight
what is actually being traded in the auction. There was a
box below the text where the user could enter an amount,
and there was a radio button below the box where the user
could select to not participate in the auction. Fig. 1 shows
an example of a popup for category Social.

Server: We developed a simple, highly responsive web-
server that the browser plugin would sync with at regular
intervals. The server accepted data (bids, responses to ques-
tions) from the plugin and stored it in a database. The main
function of the server was to run auctions. For each category
of website, and for each type of PII (there were 4 types per
category, as explained in Section 3.5, questions a1–a4), we
set an auction to run once 20 bids were in. We pooled all
these auctions, ran them once every morning, and sent out

5Such a monolithic categorization does have limitations;
large service providers like Facebook or blogspot host con-
tent belonging to multiple categories. However, we consis-
tenly pick the ﬁrst category as put out by Alexa. This en-
sures that we do not have any false positives – Facebook will
always be categorized as Social. In addition, the questions
we pose users (Table 1) for a certain category are always
consistent; questions on Facebook are always related to So-
cial. We leave a detailed categorization mechanism to future
work.

results to participants via emails. The entire process was
automated.
3.4 Procedure

We ran the study in September of 2011. After following
our study advertisement on a famous Web portal and sign-
ing up for the study, participants were selected based on our
unique ﬁltering criteria – users of the Firefox web browser
– and invited via email to participate in our study. We
asked participants to ﬁll a recruitment questionnaire which
focused on demographics as well as their general Internet
privacy knowledge and perception. We explained to partici-
pants that the study consisted of three phases: (1) an initial
week where the popups were inactive, and their browsing be-
havior would be collected, (2) the actual study that lasted
two weeks where popups were active, and (3) the ﬁnal ques-
tionnaire.

Phase 1. During the ﬁrst week, the plugin silently recorded

the browsing behavior of participants (with their consent).
The information captured during this phase was used to
record a user’s baseline browsing behavior. We used this
information to make sure that our popups were not interfer-
ing with the normal browsing behavior of the participants.
We extracted the frequency distribution across the visited
sites for every user. We will refer to this as the user’s ﬁn-
gerprint.

Phase 2. During the experiment, the plugin displayed
popups when the participants were browsing the internet.
The popups contained two kinds of questions: questions
about valuing PII – used as the basis for the auctions –
and questions on participants’ perceptions and knowledge
of PII. To avoid the popups being too invasive the plugin
displayed at most one popup per category per day. Addi-
tionally, there was a minimum delay of 10 minutes between
any two popups.

Phase 3. At the end of the experiment, we asked par-
ticipants to ﬁll in a post-study questionnaire that aimed to
clarify the main results obtained during the study.
3.5 Measures

Table 1 summarizes the questions that we presented to
the user during the entire study, along with their associ-
ated measures. We customized popup questions (a1–a4 and
p1–p4, described below), according to the context they were
asked in. Questions about PII unrelated to the website cur-
rently being visited are context independent. For instance,
a question about a user’s age while at a news website could

192Table 1: Questions asked during the diﬀerent phases of the study.

be considered context independent. Conversely, questions
about PII that are related to the current website are called
context dependent. For instance, ﬁnancial transactions on
a banking website. Additionally, the content of some ques-
tions was customized according to the category of the web-
site they refer to, as explained in Table 1.

Recruitment (r1–r4). Questions in the recruitment
questionnaire aimed to gauge participants’ knowledge of pri-
vacy related issues.

Privacy Valuation (a1–a4). These questions were pre-
sented to participants with a plugin popup during the auc-
tions, and asked them to bid the minimum value they would

accept to sell their PII. We were deliberately vague about
how we were going to use their PII for two reasons: (i) to re-
alistically reﬂect the conditions that exist today, as there is
little knowledge of how one’s PII is being used (targeted ad-
vertisements, price discrimination [31]), and (ii) not to bias
the user by providing a speciﬁc use case of their PII; for in-
stance using PII for behavioral targeting can be construed
positively or negatively.

Question a1 is context independent. Its purpose was to
assess the validity of our measures by contrasting with re-

but while the former asks about the same PII item across

the latter is customized for each category of web-
sites. Our goal was not to produce generalized estimates of
context valuation but rather to understand whether online
context had an inﬂuence on the valuation that people attach
to certain types of PII. Furthermore, we chose to ask a2 as
this is the information that most entities engaged in large
scale tracking across the web (like DoubleClick) have access
to, and hence can monetize. These are often referred to as
‘third’ parties. Questions a3-a4 are category speciﬁc and in
most cases, this PII is available only to the service provider
actually providing that service (e.g., photos on social net-
works, ﬁnancial transactions, online purchase history, etc.).
These are referred to as publishers or ‘ﬁrst’ parties.

Privacy Perception (p1–p4). These questions were
also presented with a plugin popup, and were designed to
understand if users are aware of monetization of their PII
by online entities.

Exit (f1–f4). These questions were asked in the ﬁnal
questionnaire in order to clarify results obtained during the
study.
3.6 Statistical Analysis

Nonparametric analysis was applied to the data consid-
ering the ordinal nature of some observed variables and
that continuous variables did not follow the normal dis-
tribution. Given that participants browsed web pages in
their natural environment without being forced to visit sites
from all categories mapped in our study – thus preserving
ecological validity, our sample had several missing values
across categories. Removing subjects that did not provide
information for all categories – as they did not browse all
types of web pages – would signiﬁcantly reduce the gen-
eralization power of our results and yield unrealistic ﬁnd-
ings based on the assumption that everybody browses web
pages from all categories considered in this study. There-
fore we opted for not using related sample analysis. Hence
diﬀerences between median bid values (or Likert scale mea-
sures) across categories were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis
test and the Mann-Whitney test whenever appropriate. As-
sociations between ordinal/interval variables were assessed
using the Spearman’s Rho test. Comparisons between re-
lated sample distributions of dichotomous variables were
performed using both the Cochran’s Q test and the Mc-
Nemar test. The level of signiﬁcance was taken as p < .05.

4. AUCTION AND SURVEY RESULTS

We summarize the main results obtained towards address-
ing our two research questions. Our results are mainly re-
ported in Euros, and at the time the conversion was approx.
e 1 gives 1.42 USD.
4.1 Results for RQ1: Monetary value of PII

Eﬀect of pop-ups on browsing behavior. We used
the L2 distance between participants’ ﬁrst week’s “baseline”
ﬁngerprints and their ﬁngerprints for the second week of the
study after pop-ups were turned on and found little diﬀer-
ences (165 users had less than 5% diﬀerence). Speciﬁcally,
only three users (2% of the sample) had high browsing be-
havior deviation and reported being on vacation during the
second week, thus explaining why they used their browser
sparsely. These ﬁndings indicate that users did not deviate
from their ‘normal’ browsing behavior when participating in
the study.

Representativeness of categories. We look into the
bidding behavior of the whole sample (N = 168) while
browsing websites as they map to each of the 8 categories
and also in relation to the nature of the information being
sold (see questions a1-a4 in Table 1). Overall, participants
visited websites from all of the eight categories, Health
being the least visited category (Search: 82%, Entertain-
ment: 82%, Social: 78%, News: 76%, Finance: 75%, Shop-
ping: 75%, Email: 64%, Health: 2%). Given the lack of
representativeness for the number of subjects visiting health
related web pages, we therefore consider only seven cate-
gories when comparing participants’ bids and other relevant
measures across categories.

Bids on context independent PII. With respect to
selling their PII that is related to their oﬄine identity (i.e.,
age, gender, address and salary; see question a1 in Table 1),
we found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among participants’ me-
dian bid values across categories (p = .702). Note that this
result was somewhat expected as question a1 was context
independent – no mention was made to selling the partici-
pants’ PI to an entity related to the website they were brows-
ing. The overall median bid value across categories was e 25.
Bids on context dependent PII. When probed about
selling clicks they performed on a given web page (see ques-
tion a2 in Table 1), which represents their browsing behav-
ior, participants’ median bids were again not signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent across categories (p = .569). In this case, the over-
all median bid value was e 7. Median bid values for highly
category speciﬁc PII – as captured by questions a3 and a4
in Table 1 – revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences across categories
(p < .001). The highest median bid values (in euros) were
from categories Finance (˜x = 15.5), Social (˜x = 12), and
Email (˜x = 6), with Finance similar to the latter two
categories (p = .31 and p = .09 respectively) and signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent from the remaining categories (Shopping =
5, News = 2, Entertainment = 2, Search = 2; p < .001).
Table 2 summarizes the most relevant descriptive statistics
of median bid values per category.

Eﬀectiveness of the auction: Categorization of the
participants’ free text responses to why they bid so low/high
in their lowest/highest bids (in euros) was categorized man-
ually with an acceptable inter-rater reliability (lowest bid:
K = .77, p < .001; highest bid: K = .78, p < .001). Even
considering the extreme case of each participant’s lowest bid,
only 15% explained that they bid that low in an attempt to
win the auction. The majority said it was because the in-
formation was not important (50 − 51%) or they thought it
was a fair value (8% − 10%), or due to some other reason
(25% − 26%). On the other hand, highest bids were mainly
due to prevent selling important information (53% − 58%),
although also being explained as a fair value (16%− 22%) or
due to some other reason (22%). Note that there are sub-
tle diﬀerences between a ‘fair’ value assigned to information,
and very high/low values assigned because information was
very important or not important at all. Fair value indicates
a more reasoned approach while bidding very high values
indicates focus on the outcome (no selling under any cir-
cumstance). Bidding very low values indicates nonchalance;
value of information is so low that it isn’t worth reason-
ing about. The fact that only 18 zero – 11 winings bids
– bids were placed during the whole auction period is an
indication that participants were not bidding just for the
sake of winning. Very few participants (3%− 4%) explained

194Table 2: Median bid values per category calculated from participants’ median bids in each category (1st and
3rd quartiles shown between brackets

their highest bid as a strategy to win the auction. These
results could indicate that the rules of the reverse second
price auction were understood. Overall, the results indicate
that the auction scheme is indeed eﬀective for truth telling,
given that the majority gave reasons of fair value or worth
of information for bids instead of trying to game the system.
Bulk PII eﬀect. We veriﬁed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the median bid value for all categories in question
a3 (˜xa3 = 5) and in question a4 (˜xa4 = 5, p = .59). This
ﬁnding indicates that the amount of information being sold
was not a factor for participants when placing their bids, as
they valued one piece of information (question a3) and 10
pieces of information of the same type (question a4), to be
used for the same period of time if sold, in a similar way.

Winning bids and pay-outs. Considering the 40 sub-
jects that won at least one auction, their median winning
bid was of 5 cents of Euro (min = 0, ¯x = 0.19, max = 2.29).
Even though we allowed a bid of 0 as a valid bid, only seven
winners bid 0 on 11 occasions, out of 4000+ bids. The other
winners’ bids were strictly positive. Finally, as we used the
reverse second price auction, the median payout was actu-
ally 45 cents of Euro (min = 0.01, ¯x = 0.65, max = 5.69).
We describe this result for completeness.

Trading PII for alternative goods. At the end of the
study, we wanted to understand if there were preferred goods
participants would be willing to trade their PII for, and if
the preferred goods would be diﬀerent across the most pop-
ular categories, i.e. Social, Email and Search (question
f2 from Table 1). According to our results, participants’ ﬁrst
choice was to either exchange their PII for money (32%−37%
of participants) or have improvements in services they are
currently using (33% − 37%). The second choice was to
receive more free services (14% − 18%). No signiﬁcant dif-
ferences were found between distributions of each strategy
across the three categories (money: Q = 2.000, p = .37,
better services: Q = 1.042, p = .59, free services: Q =
1.805, p = .41).
Interestingly, receiving PII-based recom-
mendations was the third option for social networks (7%),
but rather the fourth for Email (2%) and Search (4%),
with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between them (Q = 6.167, p =
.046). Fig. 2 shows a graph comparing the participants’ pre-
ferred monetization strategies across the three categories.

Relationship between bids, demographics, and pri-
vacy. We next looked into signiﬁcant associations between
variables captured in the recruitment questionnaire and the
participants’ bids. Our ﬁndings reveal a medium negative
correlation between participants’ age and their median bid
values for question Social-a3 (n = 64, ρ = −.276, p = .03).
Similarly, age is negatively correlated to the combination of
questions Social-a3 and Social-a4 (n = 69, ρ = −.287,
p = .02), thus providing evidence that the older people are,
the lower they tend to bid on photos they share online. Fur-
thermore, we found a medium negative association between

search engines.

gender (1 = male, 2 = female) and median bids for ques-
tion Email-a3 (n = 45, ρ = −.333, p = .03). This result
indicates that men might value information related to their
email contacts more than women. Correlations between in-
come levels and bid values were not signiﬁcant. Finally, we
found medium negative correlations between participants’
education level and their median bid values for question a2
in most categories (Entertainment: ρ = −.277, Finance:
ρ = −.282, Search: ρ = −.235, Shopping: ρ = −.32).

We also correlated bid values with responses provided
to privacy-relevant questions in the recruitment question-
naire. Positive correlations were found between being wor-
ried about online data protection and higher bids on context
independent PII (question a1, Entertainment: ρ = .252,
Finance: ρ = .278, Search: ρ = .23).

4.2 Results for RQ2: Perceptions around us-

age of PII

Results presented in this subsection contribute to the un-
derstanding of how users’ perceive the economic usage of
their PII by online service providers. Note that we consid-
ered only the ﬁrst answers that participants gave to ques-
tions p1–p4 per category. This decision guaranteed that
their initial opinion would be taken into account instead of
a potentially biased opinion due to the eﬀect of long expo-
sure to the study.

Knowledge of PII-based monetization. Participants
were aware that PII shared on a particular web site could be
used to generate revenue (question p1, ˜x = 4, q1 = 2, q3 =
4). Moreover, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between
median ratings across categories (p = .107). This ﬁnding
suggests that knowledge of PI-based monetization is related
to Internet services in general and not to a particular set of
services.

Comfort with PII-based monetization. In question
p2, participants revealed how comfortable they were with
web sites extracting revenue out of their PII. With a median

able with it, and this feeling was shared across categories as
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between participants’ median rat-
ings per category could be found (p = .429). From this
ﬁnding, we conclude that the act of monetizing from users’
PII is what generally makes people uncomfortable, and not
the type of online service providers the revenue will go to
(e.g., ﬁnance, search, etc.).

Improving services with PII. Although not comfort-
able with their PII being monetized, participants pointed
out that they would like online companies to improve their
web services using their PII (question p3, ˜x = 4, q1 = 3,
q3 = 4). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between par-
ticipants’ median ratings across categories (p = .869). This
ﬁnding is consistent with results presented in Fig. 2 about
money and improved services being the participants’ pre-
ferred PII monetization strategies.

PII-based publicity/ads. Finally, subjects were in-
diﬀerent with regards to online service providers making
personalized publicity/ads by using their PII (question p4,
˜x = 3, q1 = 3, q3 = 4). Once again no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence could be identiﬁed between participants’ median rat-
ings across categories (p = .686). This ﬁnding suggests that
leveraging users’ PII to provide them with personalized ads
generally have neither a negative nor a positive impact on
people.

Perception of costs and revenues. Participants were
more conﬁdent about revenues than costs of providing so-
cial network, email, and search services (answered “do not
know”: 3% vs. 29%, 10% vs. 24%, 6% vs. 21% respec-
tively). In general, most participants agree that these service
providers have high revenues (93%, 69%, and 89% respec-
tively) and high costs (43%, 45%, and 53% respectively),
but the perception of revenues is signiﬁcantly higher than
costs (p < .001 for each of the three categories). Finally,
more participants perceived search services to have signiﬁ-
cant costs compared to email (68% n = 117 vs. 58% n =
113, p = .02), while more participants perceived social net-
work and search services to have signiﬁcant earnings com-
pared to email (97% n = 143 vs. 77% n = 133, p < 001;
94% n = 139 vs. 77% n = 133, p < .001 respectively). These
results reveal that users might consider social network ser-
vices to be more proﬁtable than search or email services.

5. DISCUSSION

The conclusions that can be derived from our results (Sec. 4)

are:

Users value oﬄine PII more and online PII less:
If we consider the results for a1, the question on valuating
oﬄine PII (Sec. 4), users consistently bid high values for
their oﬄine PII like age, gender, address and ﬁnancial status;
pieces of PII that form their oﬄine identity, to trade with
online entities. Likewise, users attach lower value to a2, a3
and a4, PII that mostly has to do with their online behavior
(a2 is exclusively about browsing history, the other two are
about online transactions). Digging deeper, we also note
that users tend to value category-speciﬁc PII (a3 and a4)
on Finance and Social, categories that are more explicitly
intertwined with one’s oﬄine identity, more than Search
and News.

We conjecture that the diﬀerence in valuation exists be-
cause of lack of awareness. Oﬄine PII is easier to valuate as
it is more explicit. It is harder to understand the implica-

tions of having your PII continuously tracked, data-mined,
and linked to an oﬄine identity [13, 37]. As a consequence,
users value such PII less.

Higher valuations than previous studies: Previous
studies on valuation of privacy or personal information have
reported lower values for various PII than what we encounter
in our results [23]. This could be for two reasons. First,
we use experience sampling that puts emphasis on valuat-
ing PII during web-browsing at the appropriate time, and
second, speciﬁc properties of the demographics (Spanish cit-
izens) could play a role. We note here that the regulatory
framework surrounding privacy in EU is much stricter than
in other parts of the world and this could aﬀect the norms
related to privacy and personal information of users. We
also note that cultural norms can play a role. Addressing
these concerns is beyond the scope of this work.

High variation of PII valuation: Bid values show
great variance, as it can be seen in the diﬀerence between
the ﬁrst and third quartiles of the seven categories (see Ta-
ble 1). We envision two hypotheses that could explain our
participants’ behavior that led to this observation: either (i)
diﬀerent PII can largely diﬀer in terms of bidding prices, or
(ii) people indeed have very little idea about how much their
PII should be valued. Future work will look into this.

Users do not distinguish between quantity of PII,
but type: We compared the median bid values for a3 and a4
across categories and found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence. These
two auction questions diﬀer only in quantity of information
being traded, with the type of PII and the context remain-
ing the same. As reported earlier, there are signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between type (Finance and Social being higher
than Search, Shopping etc.)

We correlated the values with demographic information as
well as the responses to the privacy related questions (r1-r4).
We found weak to no correlation. A possible conjecture can
be on the lines of what is reported in [9], that users factor in
diminishing returns of more information in their valuation
– although we have no evidence to support or refute this
conjecture.

Older users less concerned about online PII: When
we correlated bid values against demographics, a high (nega-
tive) correlation occurred between age and category speciﬁc
PII on Social, Entertainment and News, and more so
while valuating bulk information (a4). For Social, this can
be linked to the fact most older users do not use online social
networks, let alone upload photos to online social networks.6
This result is in contrast to previous work that stated that
older users are generally more concerned about their privacy,
while being online [33].

Users do not like monetization of their PII: Users
are negative when it comes to their PII being used for mon-
etization by entities (question p2), despite knowing that on-
line entities collect and use their PII for monetization (p1).
In addition, they prefer their PII to be used for improv-
ing the services they are oﬀered (ap3), across all categories.
On the one hand, these results are expected – the former
deals with monetization of a good (PII) that users probably
perceive as theirs, while users view the latter as a positive
outcome of their PII being exploited. In order to understand
why users are negative about their PII being monetized, one

demographics-to-facebook-com/

196can posit that most users are not aware of the functioning of
the online ecosystem in place – they do not perceive that the
services they get for ‘free’ (storage in Gmail, Bing search,
Facebook etc.) actually are expensive (large datacenters,
equipment and bandwidth costs) and while users are aware
of their PII being monetized, they are possibly not aware
that large parts of that monetization goes towards provid-
ing them with a ‘free’ service.

However, when we look at the results from the post-study
questionnaire (question f3), we ﬁnd that users indeed seem
to be aware of the costs and revenues of diﬀerent services
with most users assigning higher revenues than costs for ser-
vices. Taken together, users’ negative attitude about mon-
etization of their PII by services can be due to a feeling of
unfairness.

Users are indiﬀerent when it comes to the use of the
PII to send them personalized ads (p4), again across cate-
gories. This is somewhat in contrast to results in [30] where
the authors report that 64% of the survey respondents (all
Americans) ﬁnd behavioral targeting invasive. The diﬀer-
ences between our results and theirs can be due to cul-
tural diﬀerences (our sample consists mainly of people from
Spain) and/or methodological diﬀerences – we used expe-
rience sampling to capture the context, while the results
reported in [30] were gathered via traditional surveys.

IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN AND FU-
TURE RESEARCH

Our study has direct implications on the monetization of
personal information online. As the focus of the study has
been towards understanding the economic aspects of PII,
we believe the ﬁndings can help in the future research topics
and new oﬀerings. We propose three major implications.
6.1 Incentives for adoption of privacy solutions
A prominent reason for the failure of adoption of most pri-
vacy solutions are the lack of proper incentives (economic or
otherwise) for various parties to support the adoption [32].
Consider online privacy; on one side there are online ser-
vice providers who have stated that they want to move up
to the ‘creepy’ line [34] on accessing and using PII, while
on the other side users are resorting to unilateral measures
like anti-tracking plugins etc.
to prevent data collection,
hence deterring service providers from supporting such pri-
vacy preserving measures.

Recent privacy preserving solutions have been designed
to preserve privacy of the users as well as provide means for
online service providers to access and monetize PII via tar-
geted ads, thereby preserving the business models of these
providers [15, 40]. Based on our ﬁndings (Fig. 2) these solu-
tions can have a better chance of adoption if they incorpo-
rated some form of economic incentives, by way of monetary
compensation to the end-user. Such economic incentives
based solutions have been proposed as well [28, 35], with
some start-ups going for such a model7.

The results in this paper provide the ﬁrst empirical foun-
dation for economic incentives by demonstrating how users
value diﬀerent types of PII for a variety of actions performed
while online. The prices can be taken to be the reserve
prices8 that users will be willing to accept to part with their

7www.personal.com
8http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation price

PII. Likewise, we have seen that diﬀerent types of PII have
diﬀerent valuations (e.g. photos in social networks vs. online
purchase history). These diﬀerences can be used by service
providers to strategically target diﬀerent types of PII. The
ﬁndings in our paper can be used as inputs to drive models
to better understand the ecosystem. For instance, a recent
proposal to address privacy breaches using insurance can
beneﬁt from our analysis to set premiums [16].

In addition, other types of incentives can also help drive
adoption of privacy preserving solutions.
If we consider
Fig. 2, users also prefer improved services that use their PII.
If service providers can convince users that there have been
improvements to the respective services and which PII bits
went into the improvements, users may be less concerned
about their privacy.

We asked participants of our study about who they would
trust to handle their PII in the case that an entity en-
ables economic transactions around their PII, in the post-
questionnaire. Users trusted themselves more than any other
entity (¯x = 5.2, ˜x = 6, q1 = 6, q3 = 6, 6-point scale). Gov-
ernment was the second most trusted entity (¯x = 3.8, ˜x = 4,
q1 = 2, q3 = 5), followed by banks (¯x = 3.5, ˜x = 4, q1 = 3,
q3 = 4) and telecommunication companies (¯x = 3.4, ˜x = 3,
q1 = 2, q3 = 4) tied in the third place (Z = −.299, p = .77).
Finally, insurance companies were considered the least trust-
ful entities for handling people’s PII (¯x = 3.1, ˜x = 3, q1 = 2,
q3 = 4). Trusting oneself with one’s PII could point to
a totally decentralized architecture for a privacy solution.
However, more work needs to be done to verify if users can
undertake the burden of dealing with all the transactions
around their PII themselves.

6.2 Transparency on monetization of PII

One of the ﬁndings reported in Sec. 4.2, is that while users
have knowledge of their PII being collected, they are not
comfortable about their PII being monetized. This lack of
awareness also plays out in valuations – while oﬄine PII and
certain types of online PII like photos and ﬁnancial transac-
tions have high valuations, presence of the user on diﬀerent
sites were valued very low. This is interesting as a behavioral
proﬁle can be constructed just by tracking users across sites
(via cookies etc.) and this proﬁle can be used to identify
users and be monetized [11]. We believe that most privacy
concerns that arise are due to lack of awareness of precisely
this fact – that PII is being monetized (participants knew
their PII could be monetized by entertainment and search
related websites, but not for the other categories).

The ﬁndings reported in this paper indicate that if online
service providers are explicit and up front about the fact
that they provide a service (email, video streaming, a social
network, etc.) for free and in return collect and monetize
PII, along with details on the speciﬁc types of PII they col-
lect, the privacy concerns of most users will be tempered.
Long privacy policies written in complicated legalese that
are seldom eﬀective [21], can be dispensed with.

For example, we can think about agreements that could
expose the amount of money required to run the service the
user is signing up for and how the revenues generated by
exploiting PII help cover those costs. This implication is
further strengthened when we factor in that majority of the
users perceive that service providers have higher revenues
than costs (Sec. 4.2), hence being transparent about costs
can help educate users. Additionally, we can have alterna-

197tive business models where the user has the option to pay
for the service that s/he is signing up for either with his/her
PII or with real money.
6.3 Bulk data mechanism

A ﬁnal implication for design is related to the indiﬀerence
in valuation for bulk quantity of data. Speciﬁcally, partic-
ipants assigned a similar value to a certain piece of PII as
to 10 pieces of the same information. This has a direct
consequence for the design of trading PII. In fact, it does
not make sense to implement mechanisms for the trade of
a single piece of information. Rather, it makes more sense
–according to these results– to design solutions that would
allow interested users to trade a bulk amount of PII. For
instance, such a mechanism could be presented during reg-
istration to a new service and extended for bulk amounts
of PII that the user will be sharing throughout the use of
the service. The eﬀect of such a design could be two fold:
on one hand it would minimize the user’s eﬀort and men-
tal load, while on the other hand it would maximize the
eﬀectiveness of the service provider’s budget expenditure.

7. RELATED WORK

Previous research has shown that valuation can depend
on the type of information release. For instance, Huber-
man [18] reported that valuation of certain bits of PII like
weight and age depends on the desirability of those bits of
information in a social context. Likewise, valuation of loca-
tion information has been found to depend on factors like
the distance traveled by the user and other factors [9, 10].
Our work diﬀers in multiple regards. First, we focus on web
browsing information of users that is of economic interest to
online services (e.g., search providers, social networks) and
such information raises privacy concerns [25, 27]. Second,
we study the eﬀects of demographic information like age,
gender, education levels and socio-economic factors on val-
uation of one’s PII. While the aforementioned works used
mostly surveys to ﬁgure out diﬀerent valuations, we use a
methodology based on experience sampling to capture PII
context and obtain valuations in-situ. Finally, whereas pre-
vious works used hypothetical payments to determine PII
valuation [10], we use actual payments, hoping to obtain a
more accurate value and have user engagement.

Another body of work that is related has to do with study-
ing the dichotomy that exists between willingness to pay
(WTP) to buy privacy protection and willingness to accept
(WTA) to reveal PII. A diﬀerence between WTP and WTA
can be indicative of an endowment eﬀect [39]: people can
place a higher value on an object that they own, in this case
PII. In our paper we do not deal with WTP vs WTA explic-
itly, instead we focus on extracting WTA for web-browsing,
while leveraging contextual factors when PII is generated
and/or released.

A majority of the work done on understanding the aware-
ness levels of users in terms of how their PII is exploited
and related privacy concerns has focused on how the actual
behavior of people deviates from what they state. This devi-
ation has been noted by Jensen & Potts [22] who also found
that there is a diﬀerence between reported knowledge and
reality; in general people do not seem to know as much about
privacy protection measures as they state. They also report
that surveys as a method should not be taken as indicative of
users’ actual behavior. Acquisti studies the reasons that af-

fect people’s behavior vis-a-vis privacy and reports bounded
rationality as well as the practice of hyperbolic discount-
ing [1]; assigning a higher value to actions involving imme-
diate gratiﬁcation than those actions leading to long-term
protection.
In this work, we focus on understanding peo-
ple’s knowledge and perception of how their PII is exploited
from an economic view-point, and use experience sampling
to capture the behavior and context and as a result, do not
suﬀer from the limitations seen in survey-based studies.

8. CONCLUSIONS

Our paper deals with the economic value that users assign
to PII. Previous literature has focused on diﬀerent types
of PII, but not web-browsing behavior, which is the focus
of this work. Previous work has also shown that privacy
valuation is a diﬃcult problem, as is aﬀected by a number
of technical, legal, social and psychological factors that lead
to inconsistencies between what people say and what they
actually do. We attempt to overcome these issues through
the use of the reﬁned Experience Sampling Method and a
truth-telling auction mechanism that incentivizes users to
participate honestly.

We found that users give more importance to PII related
to their oﬄine identities than to PII that is related to their
online behavior. They mostly do not care about the quan-
tity of PII released but they do care about its type. Users
tolerate the use of their personal information for improv-
ing service, they do not like their information to be used to
generate revenues. Users also preferred trading in their PII
for money or improved services, and targeted advertising,
in this order. We hope the results in this paper can guide
future privacy research and solutions.
