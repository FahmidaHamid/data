ABSTRACT
In the era when Facebook and Twitter dominate the market
for social media, Google has introduced Google+ (G+) and
reported a signiﬁcant growth in its size while others called it
a ghost town. This begs the question that ”whether G+ can
really attract a signiﬁcant number of connected and active
users despite the dominance of Facebook and Twitter?”.

This paper tackles the above question by presenting a de-
tailed characterization of G+ based on large scale measure-
ments. We identify the main components of G+ structure,
characterize the key features of their users and their evolu-
tion over time. We then conduct detailed analysis on the
evolution of connectivity and activity among users in the
largest connected component (LCC) of G+ structure, and
compare their characteristics with other major OSNs. We
show that despite the dramatic growth in the size of G+,
the relative size of LCC has been decreasing and its connec-
tivity has become less clustered. While the aggregate user
activity has gradually increased, only a very small fraction
of users exhibit any type of activity. To our knowledge, our
study oﬀers the most comprehensive characterization of G+
based on the largest collected data sets.

INTRODUCTION

A signiﬁcant majority of today’s Internet users rely on
Facebook and Twitter for their online social interactions.
In June of 2011, Google launched a new Online Social Net-
work (OSN), called Google+ (or G+ for short) in order to
claim a fraction of the social media market and its associated
proﬁt. G+ oﬀers a combination of Facebook- and Twitter-
like services in order to attract users from both rivals. There

has been several oﬃcial reports about the rapid growth of
G+’s user population (400M users in Sep 2012) [1] while
some observers and users dismissed these claims and called
G+ a “ghost town” [2]. This raises the following important
question: “Can a new OSN such as G+ really attract a sig-
niﬁcant number of engaged users and be a relevant player
in the social media market?”. A major Internet company
such as Google, with many popular services, is perfectly po-
sitioned to implicitly or explicitly require (or motivate) its
current users to join its OSN. Then, it is interesting to assess
to what extent and how Google might have leveraged its po-
sition to make users join G+. Nevertheless, any growth in
the number of users in an OSN is really meaningful only if
the new users adequately connect to the rest of the network
(i.e., become connected) and become active by using some of
the oﬀered services by the OSN on a regular basis. We also
note that today’s Internet users are much more savvy about
using OSN services and connecting to other users than users
a decade ago when Facebook and Twitter became popular.
This raises other related questions: “how has the connectiv-
ity and activity of G+ users evolved over time as users have
become signiﬁcantly more experienced about using OSNs?”
and “whether these evolution patterns exhibit diﬀerent char-
acteristics compared to earlier major OSNs?”. These evo-
lution patterns could also oﬀer an insight on whether users
willingly join G+ or are added to the system by Google.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive measurement-
based characterization of connectivity and activity among
G+ users and their evolution over time in order to shed
an insightful light on all the above questions. We start by
providing a brief overview of G+ in Section 2. One of our
contributions is our measurement methodology to eﬃciently
capture complete snapshots of G+’s largest connected com-
ponent (LCC), several large sets of randomly selected users,
and all the publicly-visible activities (i.e., user posts) of LCC
users with their associated reactions from other users. To
our knowledge, this is one of the largest and more diverse
collection of datasets used to characterize an OSN. We de-
scribe our datasets in Section 3 along with our measurement
methodology.

In Section 4, using our LLC snapshots, we characterize the
evolution of the LCC size during the past year. Furthermore,
we leverage the randomly selected users to characterize the
relative size of the main components (i.e., LCC, small par-

483titions, and singletons) of G+ network and the evolution
of their relative size over time along with the fraction of
publicly visible posts and proﬁle attributes for users in each
component. Our results show that while the size of the LCC
has increased at an impressive pace over the past year, its
relative size has consistently decreased such that the LCC
currently makes up only 1/3rd of the network and the rest
of the users are mostly singletons. The large and growing
fraction of singletons appears to be caused by Google’s in-
tegrated registration process that implicitly creates a G+
account for any new Google account regardless of the user’s
interest. Furthermore, we discover that LCC users gener-
ate most of the public posts and provide a larger number of
attributes in their proﬁle. Since LCC users form the most
important component of G+ network, we focus the rest of
our analysis on the LCC.

We then turn our attention to the publicly visible activity
of LCC users and its evolution during the entire lifetime of
G+ in Section 5. We discover that the aggregate number of
posts by LCC users and their reactions (namely comments,
plusones or reshares) from other users have been steadily
increasing over time. Furthermore, a very small fraction of
LCC users generate posts and the posts from an even smaller
fraction of these users receive most of the reactions from
other users, i.e., user actions and reactions are concentrated
around a very small fraction of LCC users. The fraction of
active LCC users has increased 60 times slower than LCC
population. The comparison of users activity among G+,
Twitter and Facebook reveals that G+ users are signiﬁcantly
less active than in the other two OSNs.

Finally, we explore the evolution of connectivity features
of the LCC in Section 6 and show that many of its features
have initially evolved but have stabilized in recent months
despite the continued signiﬁcant growth in its population,
i.e., the connectivity features appear to have reached a level
of maturity. Interestingly, many connectivity features of the
current G+ network have a striking similarity with the same
feature in Twitter but are very diﬀerent from Facebook.
More speciﬁcally, the fraction of reciprocated edges among
LCC users are small (and mostly associated with low degree
and non-active users) and the LCC network has become in-
creasingly less clustered. Furthermore, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the popularity (i.e., number
of followers) and rate of posts of individual G+ users.
In
summary, the similarity of connectivity features for G+ and
Twitter networks coupled with the concentration of posting
activity (and their reaction) on a small fraction of popular
users and the small fraction of bidirectional relationships
in the LCC indicate that G+ network is primarily used for
broadcasting information.

2. GOOGLE+ OVERVIEW

After a few unsuccessful attempts (Buzz [7], Wave [19]
and Orkut [20, 21]), Google launched G+ on June 28th 2011
with the intention of becoming a major player in the OSNs
market. Users were initially allowed to join by invitation.
On September 20th, G+ became open to public and the
G+ Pages service was launched on November 7th 2011 [13,
14]. This service imitates the Facebook Pages enabling busi-
nesses to connect with interested users. Furthermore, also
in November 2011, the registration process was integrated
with other Google services (e.g., Gmail, YouTube) [17, 18].

G+ features have some similarity to Facebook and Twit-
ter. Similar to Twitter (and diﬀerent from Facebook) the re-
lationships in G+ are unidirectional. More speciﬁcally, user
A can follow user B in G+ and view all of B’s public posts
without requiring the relationship to be reciprocated. We
refer to A as B’s follower and to B as A’s friend. Moreover,
a user can also control the visibility of a post to a speciﬁc
subset of its followers by grouping them into circles. This
feature imitates Facebook approach to control visibility of
shared content. It is worth noting that this circle-based pri-
vacy setting is rather complex for average users to manage
and thus unskilled users may not use it properly1.

Each user has a stream (similar to Facebook wall) where
any activity performed by the user appears. The main ac-
tivity of a user is to make a “post”. A post consists of some
(or no) text that may have one or more attached ﬁles, called
“attachments”. Each attachment could be a video, a photo
or any other ﬁle. Other users can react to a particular post
in three diﬀerent ways: (i) Plusone: this is similar to the
“like” feature in Facebook with which other users can indi-
cate their interest in a post, (ii) Comment: other users can
make comments on a post, and (iii) Reshare: this feature
is similar to a “retweet” in Twitter and allows other users
resend a post to their followers.

G+ assigns a numerical user ID and a proﬁle to each user.
The user ID is a 21-digit integer where the highest order
digit is always 1 (e.g., 113104553286769158393). Our exam-
ination of the assigned IDs did not reveal any clear strategy
for ID assignment (e.g., based on time or mod of certain
numbers). Note that this extremely large ID space (1020) is
sparsely populated (large distance between user IDs) which
in turn makes identifying valid user IDs by generating ran-
dom numbers impractical. Similar to other OSNs, G+ users
have a proﬁle that has 17 ﬁelds where they can provide a
range of information and pointers (e.g., to their other pages)
about themselves. However, providing this information (ex-
cept for sex) is not mandatory for creating an account and
thus users may leave some (or all) attributes in their proﬁle
empty. Furthermore, users can limit the visibility of speciﬁc
attributes by deﬁning them as “private” and thus visible to
a speciﬁc group2. For a more detailed description of G+
functionality we refer the reader to [11, 12].

3. MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY AND

DATASETS

This section presents our techniques for data collection
(and validation) and then a summary of our datasets that
we use for our analysis.
Capturing LCC Structure: To capture the connectivity
structure of the Largest Connected Component (LCC), we
use a few high-degree users as starting seeds and crawl the
structure using a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS) strategy. Our
initial examination revealed that the allocated users IDs are
very evenly distributed across the ID space. We leverage
this feature to speed up our crawler as follows: We divide
the ID space into 21 equal-size zones and assign a crawler to
only crawl users whose ID falls in a particular zone. Given
user u in zone i, the assigned crawler to zone i collects the

1A clear example of this complexity is the diagram provided
to guide users to determine their privacy setting in [8].
2Note that it is not possible to distinguish whether a non
visible attribute is private or not speciﬁed by the user.

proﬁle along with the list of friends and followers for user u.
Any newly discovered users whose ID is in zone i are placed
in a queue to be crawled whereas discovered users from other
zones are periodically reported to a central coordinator. The
coordinator maps all the reported users by all 21 crawlers
to their zone and periodically (once per hour) sends a list of
discovered users in each zone to the corresponding crawler.
This strategy requires infrequent and eﬃcient coordination
with crawlers and enables them to crawl their zones in par-
allel. The crawl of each zone is completed when there is
no more users in that zone to crawl. After some tuning,
the average rate of discovery for each crawler reached 800K
users per hour or 16.8M users per day for the whole system3.
With this rate, it takes 4-6 days to capture a full snapshot
of the LCC connectivity and users’ proﬁles. Table 1 sum-
marizes the main characteristics of our LCC datasets. We
obtained the LCC-Dec snapshot from an earlier study on
G+[39]. We examined the connectivity of all the captured
LCC snapshots and veriﬁed that all of them form a single
connected component.
Sampling Random Users: Our goal is to collect random
samples of G+ users for our analysis. To our knowledge,
none of the prior studies on G+ achieved this goal. The
sparse utilization of the extremely large ID space makes it
infeasible to identify random users by generating random
IDs. To cope with this challenging problem, we leverage the
search function of the G+ API to eﬃciently identify a large
number of seemingly random users. The function provides
a list of up to 1000 users whose name or surname matches
a given input keyword. Careful inspection of search results
for a few surnames revealed that G+ appears to order the
reported users based on their level of connectivity and ac-
tivity, i.e. users with a higher connectivity or activity (that
are likely to be more interesting) are listed at the top of
the result. Since searching for popular surnames most likely
results in more than 1000 users, the reported users are bi-
ased samples. To avoid this bias, we selected a collection of
1.5K random American surnames from the US4 2000 cen-
sus [9] with low to moderate popularity and used the search
function of the API to obtain matched G+ users. We con-
sider the list of reported users only if it contains less than
1000 users. These users are assumed to be random sam-
ples because G+ must report all matched users, and there

3LCC-Apr snapshot was collected before this tuning and
therefore it took longer.
4US is the most represented country in G+ [39, 44]. Fur-
thermore, the high immigration level of US allows to ﬁnd
surnames from diﬀerent geographical regions.

Table 4: Features of other datasets in our analysis

is no correlation between surname popularity and the con-
nectivity (or activity) of the corresponding users. Table 2
summarizes the main characteristics of our random datasets.
Note that the timing of each one of the random datasets is
aligned with a LCC dataset.

To validate the above strategy, we collect two groups of
more than 140K samples from the search API, users whose
name match popular and unpopular (< 1000 users) sur-
names, in Sep 2012. We focus on samples from each group
that are located in the LCC since we have a complete snap-
shot of the LCC that can be used as ground truth. In par-
ticular, we compare the connectivity of samples from each
group that are located in the LCC with all users in the
LCC-Sep snapshot. Figure 1 plots the distribution of the
number of followers and friends for these two groups of sam-
ples and all users in the LCC, respectively. These ﬁgures
clearly demonstrate that only the collected LCC samples
from unpopular surnames exhibit very similar distributions
of followers and friends with the entire LCC. A Kolgomorov-
Smirnov test conﬁrms that they are indeed the same distri-
bution. The collected samples from popular surnames have
a stronger connectivity and thus are biased.
Capturing User Activity: We consider user activity as
a collection of all posts by individual users and the reaction
(i.e. Plusones, Comments and Reshares) from other users
to these posts. User activity is an important indicator of
user interest and thus the aggregate activity (and reactions)
across users is a good measure of an OSN popularity. De-
spite its importance, we are not aware of any prior study
that examined this issue among G+ users. Toward this end,
we focus on user activity in the most important element of
the network (i.e. the LCC). We leverage the G+ API to col-
lect all the public posts and their associated reactions for all
LCC-Sep users between G+ release date (Jun 28th 2011) and
the date our measurement campaign started (Sep 7th 2012),
i.e. 437 days. Given the cumulative nature of recorded ac-
tivity for each user, a single snapshot of activity contains all
the activities until our data collection time. Furthermore,
since each post has a timestamp, we are able to determine
the temporal pattern of all posts from all users. Note, that
the G+ API limits the number of daily queries to 10K per
registered application. Then, we use 303 accounts to collect
the referred data in 68 days. Table 3 summarizes the main
features of the activity dataset. In particular, note that only
13.6M (out of 85M) LCC-Sep users made at least one public
post in the analyzed period.

Other datasets: There are a few other datasets for Twitter
and Facebook that we have either collected or obtained from
other researchers. Table 4 summarizes the main features of
these datasets.
In the absence of any public dataset for
Facebook, we developed our own crawler and collected the
proﬁle (FB-Pro) connectivity (FB-Con) and activity (FB-
Act) for random Facebook users. We also collect the proﬁle
(TW-Pro) for random Twitter users.
4. MACRO-LEVEL STRUCTURE & ITS EVO-

LUTION

The macro-level connectivity structure among G+ users
should intuitively consist of three components: (i) The largest
connected component (LCC), (ii) A number of partitions
that are smaller than the LCC (with at least 2 users), and
(iii) Singletons or isolated users. We ﬁrst examine the tem-
poral evolution of the LCC size and then discuss the relative
size of diﬀerent components and their evolution over time.
Evolution of the LCC Size: Having multiple snapshots
of the LCC at diﬀerent times enables us to examine the
growth in the number of LCC users over time and deter-
mine the number of users who depart or arrive between two
consecutive snapshots as shown in Figure 2 using log scale
for the y axis. This ﬁgure illustrates that the overall size of
the LCC has increased from 35M to 52M in four months be-
tween December 2011 and April 2012 at an average growth
rate of 155K users per day. This average rate has even in-
creased to 207K users per day between April and November
2012. The connectivity of these users to the LCC is a clear
sign that they have intentionally joined G+ by making the
explicit eﬀort to connect to other users (i.e., these are inter-
ested users). While the daily rate of increase in the number
of interested users (150K-200K) is impressive, it is an or-
der of magnitude smaller than the .95-1.8M daily increase
in the total population of G+ users that is oﬃcially reported
by Google [1]. The diﬀerence between the rate of growth for
the overall system and LCC must be due to other compo-
nents of the network (small partitions and singletons) as we
explore later in this section.

We observed some short term variations in the growth
rate of LCC users (as shown in Figure 2) which is consistent
with the reported results by another recent study on another
large OSN [28]. Figure 2 also shows that LCC users have
been departing the LCC at an average rate of 9.6K users

per day. We carefully examined these departing users and
discovered two points: (i) all of the departing users have re-
moved their G+ accounts, and (ii) the distribution of #fol-
lowers, #friends and public attributes of departing users is
very similar to all LCC users, however most of them are in-
active. This seems to suggest that the departing users have
lost their interest due to the lack of incentives to actively
participate in the system.
Evolution of the Main Components: To estimate the
relative size of each component and its evolution over time,
we determine the mapping of users in a random dataset to
the three main components of the G+ structure. LCC users
can be easily detected using the corresponding LCC snap-
shot for each random dataset (e.g., LCC-Oct for Rand-Oct).
For all the users outside the LCC, we perform a BFS crawl
from each user to verify whether a user is a singleton or part
of a partition, and in the latter case determine the size of the
partition. The ﬁrst part of Table 5 presents the relative size
of all three components using our random datasets in April,
October and November of 20125. Table 5 shows that the
relative size of the LCC has dropped from 43% (in Apr) to
32% (in Oct and Nov) while the relative size of singletons has
increased from 55% to 66% during the same period. Note
that this drop in the relative size of the LCC occurs despite
the dramatic increase in the absolute size of the LCC (as
we reported earlier). This simply indicates an even more
signiﬁcant increase in the number of singletons. We believe
that this huge increase in the number of singletons is a side
eﬀect of the integrated registration procedure that Google
has implemented. In this procedure, a new G+ account is
implicitly created for any user that creates a new Google
account to utilize a speciﬁc Google service such as Gmail or
YouTube6. The implicit addition of these new users to G+
suggests that they may not even be aware of (or do not have
any interest in) their G+ accounts. The relatively small and

5It is possible that our approach incorrectly categorizes user
u as a singleton if u has a private list of friends and followers
and, all of u’s friends and followers also have a private list
of followers and friends. However, we believe this is rather
unlikely. Indeed our BFS crawl on the LCC identiﬁed about
7.5% users with private friend and follower lists who were
detected through their neighbors.
6In fact, we examined and conﬁrmed this hypothesis for new
Gmail and YouTube accounts.

Table 5: Fraction of G+ users, active users and users with public attributes across G+ components along with
the evolution of these characteristics from April to November of 2012 (based on the corresponding Random
datasets)

decreasing size of the LCC for the G+ network exhibits a
completely diﬀerent characteristic than the one reported for
the LCC of other major OSNs. For instance, 99.91% of the
registered Facebook users were part of the LCC as of May
2011 [46] and the LCC of Twitter included 94.8% of the
users with just 0.2% singletons in August 2009 [26]. Fur-
thermore, Leskovec et al. [38] showed that the relative size
of the LCC of other social networks (e.g., the arXiv citation
graph or an aﬃliation network) has typically increased with
time until it included more than 90% of their users.
Partitions make up only a small and rather stable fraction
(1.5%) of all G+ users. We identiﬁed tens of thousands of
such partitions and discovered that 99% of these partitions
have less than 4 users in all snapshots. The largest partition
was detected in Rand-Apr snapshot with 52 users.

The last two parts of Table 5 present the fraction of all G+
users that have at least one public post or provide public at-
tributes in their proﬁles (on the last row) and the breakdown
of these two groups across diﬀerent components of the G+
network. We observe that the fraction of users that gener-
ate at least one public post has dropped from 10% to 8.7%,
and the majority of them are part of the LCC. Similarly,
the fraction of users with at least one public attribute have
dropped from roughly 30% to 24% over the same period. A
large but decreasing fraction of these users are part of the
LCC and a smaller but growing fraction of them are single-
tons. Since the LCC is the well connected component that
contains the majority of active users, we focus our remaining
analysis only on the LCC.

In summary, the absolute size of the LCC in the G+ net-
work has been growing by 150-200K users/day while its rel-
ative size has been decreasing. This is primarily due to the
huge increase in the number of singletons that is caused by
the implicit addition of new Google account holders to G+.
In November of 2012, the LCC made up 1/3rd and the rest
of the network mostly consists of singletons. Less than 9%
of G+ users generate any post, and less than 25% provide
any public attribute, and a majority of both groups are LCC
users.

5. PUBLIC ACTIVITY & ITS EVOLUTION
To investigate users activity, we characterize publicly visi-
ble (or in short ”public”) posts by LCC users as well as other
users’ reactions (including users outside the LCC) to these
public posts7.

An earlier study used ground-truth data to show that
more than 30% of posts in G+ were public during the ini-

7We are not aware of any technique to capture private posts
in G+ for obvious reasons. It might be feasible to create a
G+ account and connect to a (potentially) large number of
users in order to collect their private posts. However, such
a technique is neither representative nor ethical.

tial phase of the system [35]. However, the proposed setting
by Google encourages users to generate public posts and
reactions since only these public activities are indexable by
search engines (including Google), and thus visible to others
(apart from Google) for various marketing and mining pur-
poses [15]. Therefore, characterizing public posts and their
reactions provides an important insight about the publicly
visible part of G+.

We recall that the main action by individual users is to
generate a “post” that may have one or more “attachments”.
Each post by a user may trigger other users to react by mak-
ing a “comment”, indicate their interest by a “plusone” (+1)
or “reshare” the post with their own followers. To maintain
the desired crawling speed for collecting activity informa-
tion, we decided to only collect the timestamp for individual
posts (but not for reactions to each post). Therefore, we use
the timestamp of each post as a good estimate for all of its
reactions because most reactions often occur within a short
time after the initial post. To validate this assumption, we
have examined the timestamp of 4M comments associated
to 700K posts and observed that more than 80% of the com-
ments occurred within the 24 hours after their corresponding
post.
Temporal Characteristics of Public Activity: Having
the timestamp for all the posts and their associated reac-
tions enables us to examine the temporal characteristics of
all public activity among LCC users during the entire 15
months of G+ operation until our measurement campaign
started.

Figure 3(a) depicts the total number of daily posts by
LCC users along with the number of daily posts that have
attachments, have at least one plusone, have been reshared
or have received comments. Note that a post may have any
combination of attachments, plusones, reshares and com-
ments (i.e., these events are not mutually exclusive). The
pronounced repeating pattern in this ﬁgure (and other simi-
lar results) is due to the weekly change in the level of activity
among G+ users that is signiﬁcantly lower during the week-
end and much higher during weekdays. The timing of most
of the observed peaks in this (and other related) ﬁgure(s) ap-
pears to be perfectly aligned with speciﬁc events as follows8:
(i) the peak on Jun 30th caused by the initial release of the
system (by invitation) [3]; (ii) the peak on Jul 11th is due to
users reaction to a major failure on Jul 9th when the system
ran out of disk [4]; (iii) the peak on Sep 20th was caused
by the public release of the system [3]; (iv) the peak on Nov
7th is due to the release of G+ Pages service [14]; (v) the
peak on Jan 17th is caused by the introduction of new func-
tionalities for auto-complete and adding text in photos [5,
6]; (vi) on Apr 12th, caused by a major redesign of G+[16].

8We could not identify any signiﬁcant event at the time of
the peaks on May 3rd, Jun 4th and Aug 7th.

Figure 5: Post-rate (x axis) vs ag-
gregate reaction rate (y axis) cor-
relation

Figure 3(a) also demonstrates that the aggregate number of
daily posts has steadily increased after the ﬁrst ﬁve months
(i.e., the initial phase of operation). We can observe that a
signiﬁcant majority of the posts have attachments but the
fraction of posts that trigger any reaction by other users is
much smaller, in addition plusones is the most common type
of reaction. Note that Figure 3(a) presents the number of
daily posts with attachments or reactions but does not re-
veal the total daily number of attachments or reactions. To
this end, Figure 3(b) depicts the temporal pattern of the ag-
gregate daily rate of attachments, plusones, comments and
reshares for all the daily posts by LCC users, i.e., multiple
attachments or reactions to the same post are counted sep-
arately. This ﬁgure paints a rather diﬀerent picture. More
speciﬁcally, the total number of comments and in particu-
lar plusone reactions have been rapidly growing after the
initial phase. Figure 3(b) illustrates that individual posts
are more likely to receive multiple plusones than any other
type of reaction, and its comparison with Figure 3(a) shows
that most post have one or two attachments. Figure 3(c)
plots the temporal pattern of user-level activity by show-
ing the daily number of active LCC users along with the
number of users for whom their posts have attachments or
triggered at least one type of reaction. This ﬁgure reveals
that the total number of users with a public post has been
steadily growing (after the initial phase) roughly at the rate
of 3K users per day. However, this rate of growth in active
users is signiﬁcantly (roughly 60 times) lower than the rate
of growth of LCC users which means only a very small frac-
tion of new LCC users (< 2%) ever become active. While a

large fraction of these users create posts with attachments,
the number of daily users whose posts trigger at least one
plusone, comment or reshare has consistently remained be-
low 1M, 0.5M and 0.25M, respectively, despite the dramatic
growth in the number of LCC users.
Skewness in Activity Contribution: We observed that
a relatively small and stable number of users with interest-
ing posts receive most reactions. This raises the question
that “how skewed are the distribution of generated posts
and associated reactions among users in G+?”. Figure 4(a)
presents the fraction of all posts in our activity dataset that
are generated by the top x% of LCC users during the life of
G+ (the x axis has a log-scale). Other lines in this ﬁg-
ure show the fraction of all attachments, plusones, com-
ments and reshares that are associated with the top x%
users that receive most reactions of each type. This ﬁgure
clearly demonstrates that the contribution of the number of
posts and the total number of associated attachments across
users is similarly very skewed. For example, the top 10% of
users contribute 80% of posts. Furthermore, the distribu-
tion of contribution of received reactions to a user’s posts is
an order of magnitude more skewed than the contribution
of total posts per user.
In particular, 1% of users receive
roughly 80% of comments and 90% of plusones and reshares.
These ﬁndings oﬀer a strong evidence that only a very small
fraction of users (around 1M) create most posts and even a
smaller fraction of these users receive most reactions from
other users to their posts, i.e., both user action and reaction
are centered around a very small fraction of users. We also
repeated a similar analysis at the post level to assess how

skewed are the number of reactions to individual posts. Fig-
ure 4(b) shows the fraction of attachments, plusones, com-
ments and reshares associated to the top x% posts. The
distribution for attachments is rather homogeneous which
indicates that most posts have one or small number of at-
tachments. For other types of reactions, the distribution
is roughly an order of magnitude less skewed that the dis-
tribution of reaction across users (Figure 4(a)) .This is a
rather expected result since reactions tend to spread across
diﬀerent posts by a user.
Correlation Between User Actions and Reactions:
Our analysis so far has revealed that actions and reactions
are concentrated on a small fraction of LCC users. However,
it is not clear whether users who generate most of the posts
are the same users who receive most of the reactions. For
example, a celebrity may generate a post infrequently but
receives lots of reaction to each post. To answer this ques-
tion, ﬁrst we examine the correlation between the number
of posts and the aggregate reaction rate for diﬀerent groups
of users grouped based on their average level of activity as
follows:
-Active users who post at least once a day (>1),
-Regular users who post less than once a day but more than
once a week ( 1
-Casual users who post less than once a week (< 1

7 -1), and

7 ).

Figure 5 shows the summary distribution of daily reac-
tion rate among users in each one of the described groups
using boxplots. This ﬁgure reveals that the reaction rate
grows exponentially with the user posting rate. Therefore,
the small group of users that contribute most posts is also
receiving the major portion of all reactions.

We have inspected the identity of the top 20 users with
a largest number of public posts to learn more about them
as well as those that receive a largest number of reactions.
While the analysis of the ﬁrst group does not reveal any
interesting ﬁnding, we observe that 18 of the top 20 users
attracting more reactions are related to music groups by
young girls from Japan and Indonesia (e.g., nmb48, ske48,
akb48, hkt48 from Japan or jkt48 from Indonesia). All these
groups are associated to the same Japanese record producer
(Yasushi Akimoto) whose G+ account is also among the top
20.
5.1 Comparison with Other OSNs

We examine a few aspects of user activity (i.e., gener-
ating posts or tweets) among G+, Twitter and Facebook

users to compare the level of user engagement in these three
OSNs. For this comparison, we leverage TW-Act and FB-
Act datasets (described in Table 4) that capture activity of
random users in the corresponding OSNs. In our analysis,
we only consider the active users in each OSN that make
up 17%, 35%, and 73% of all users in G+, Facebook and
Twitter, respectively.
Activity Rate: Figure 6(a) shows the distribution of the
average activity rate per user across all active users in each
OSN. The activity rate is measured as the total number of
posts or tweets divided by the time between the timestamp
of a user’s ﬁrst collected action and our measurement time.
This ﬁgure reveals the following two basic points in compar-
ing these three OSNs: (i) the activity rate among Facebook
and G+ users are more homogeneous than across Twitter
users, (ii) Facebook users are the most active (with a typi-
cal rate of 0.19 posts/day) while G+ users exhibit the least
activity rate (with a typical rate of 0.08 posts/day).
Recency of Last Activity: An important aspect of user
engagement is how often individual users generate a post.
We can compute the recency of the last post by each ac-
tive user as the time between the timestamp of the last post
and our measurement time. The distribution of this metric
across a large number of active users provides an insight on
how often active users generate a post. Figure 6(b) depicts
the distribution of recency of the last post across G+, Twit-
ter and Facebook users. We have divided the users from
each OSN into three groups of casual, regular and active
users based on their average activity rate (< 1
7 -1, >1
post/day) as we described earlier. We observe that among
casual users in all three OSNs, Facebook and Twitter users
typically generate posts much more frequently (i.e., have
lower median recency) than casual G+ users. Regular users
in diﬀerent OSNs exhibit the same relative order in their
typical recency of last post. Finally, for active users, it is
not surprising to observe that all three OSNs show roughly
the same level of recency.
Public User Attributes: We compare the willingness of
users in diﬀerent OSNs to publicly share their attributes in
their proﬁle. While this is not related to user activity, it
is an indicator of user engagement and interest in an OSN.
Roughly 48% of all the LCC users in G+ were providing at
least one extra attribute in addition to their sex in April
2012. This ratio decreased and then stabilized around 44%
in our last few LCC snapshots. We further examine the
distribution of the number of visible attributes across LCC

Figure 8: Degree Distribution for diﬀerent snap-
shots of G+, Twitter and Facebook

users for diﬀerent LCC snapshots and compare them with
480K random Facebook users (in FB-Pro dataset from Ta-
ble 4) in Figure 7. We recall that there are 21 diﬀerent
attributes in Facebook proﬁle. Figure 7 shows that the dis-
tribution for all LCC snapshots is identical. Also G+ users
publicly share a much smaller number of attributes com-
pared to Facebook users.
In particular, half of the users
publicly share at least 6 attributes on Facebook while less
than 10% of G+ users share 6 attributes. Twitter proﬁle
only has 6 attributes and 3 of them are mandatory. The
examination of TW-Pro dataset shows that 69% and 13%
of Twitter users share 0 and 1 non-mandatory attribute, re-
spectively. In short, G+ users appear to share more public
and non-mandatory attributes than Twitter users but sig-
niﬁcantly less than Facebook users.

In summary, the analysis of diﬀerent aspects of user activ-
ity in G+ resulted in the following important points: (i) The
number of active LCC users has steadily grown but roughly
60 times slower than the whole LCC population. (ii) Around
10% of LCC users generate a majority of all posts and only
1/10th of these users receive most of the reactions of any
type to their posts. This is due to the fact that the rate of
received reactions is strongly correlated with the user posting
rate. (iii) The comparison of user activity for G+ with Face-
book and Twitter revealed that Facebook and Twitter users
exhibit a higher rate of generating posts.

6. LCC CONNECTIVITY & ITS EVOLUTION

In this section, we focus on the evolution of diﬀerent fea-
tures of connectivity among LCC users over time as the sys-
tem becomes more populated, and compare these features
with other OSNs.
Degree Distribution: The node degree distribution is one
of the basic features of connectivity. Since G+ structure is
a directed graph, we separately examine the distribution of
the number of followers in Figure 8(a) and friends in Fig-
ure 8(b). Each ﬁgure shows the corresponding distribution
across users in each one of our LCC snapshots, among Twit-
ter users in TW-Con snapshot, and the distribution of neigh-
bors for random Facebook users in FB-Con snapshots9. This
ﬁgure demonstrates a few important points: First, the dis-
tributions of followers and friends for G+ users can be ap-
proximated by a power law distribution with α = 1.26 and

9Note that Facebook forces bidirectional relationships.
Therefore, the distribution for Facebook in both ﬁgures is
the same.

1.39 in LCC-Nov snapshot, respectively. A similar property
has been reported for the degree distribution of other OSNs
including Twitter [37], RenRen [34], and Flickr or Orkut
[42]. Second, comparing the shape of the distribution across
diﬀerent LCC snapshots, we observe that both distributions
look very similar for all LCC snapshots. The only exception
is the earliest LCC snapshot (LCC-Dec) that has a less pop-
ulated tail. This comparison illustrates that the shape of
both distributions has initially evolved as the LCC became
signiﬁcantly more populated and users with larger degree
appeared, and then the shape of distributions has stabilized
in recent months. Third, interestingly, the shape of the most
recent distribution of followers and friends for G+ users is
very similar to the corresponding distribution for Twitter
users. The only diﬀerence appears in the tail of the distri-
bution of number of friends which is due to the limit of 5K
friends imposed by G+ [10]. The stability of the distribu-
tion of friends and followers for G+ users in recent months
coupled with their striking similarity with these features in
Twitter indicates that the degree distribution for G+ network
has reached a level of maturity. Fourth, while the distribu-
tions for Facebook are not directly comparable due to its
bidirectional nature, Figure 8 shows that the distribution of
degree for Facebook users does not follow a power law [46]
as they generally exhibit a signiﬁcantly larger degree than
Twitter and G+ users. Speciﬁcally, 56% of Facebook users
have more than 100 neighbors while only 3.6% (and 0.8%) of
the G+ (and Twitter) users maintain that number of friends
and followers.
Balanced Connectivity & Reciprocation: Our exam-
ination shows that the percentage of bidirectional relation-
ships between LCC users has steadily dropped from 32%
(in Dec 2011) and became rather stable in recent months
around 21.3% (in Nov 2012). Again, we observe that this
feature of connectivity among LCC users in G+ seems to
have reached a quasi-stable status after the system have ex-
perienced a major growth. Interestingly, Kwak et al.
[37]
reported a very similar fraction of bidirectional relationships
(22%) in their Twitter snapshot from July 2009. This reveals
yet another feature of G+ connectivity that is very similar
to the Twitter network and very diﬀerent from the fully
bidirectional Facebook network. In order to gain a deeper
insight on this aspect of connectivity, we examine the frac-
tion of bidirectional connections for individual nodes and its
relation with the level of (im)balance between node inde-
gree and outdegree. This in turn provides a valuable clue
about the user level connectivity and reveals whether users

490exchange or simply relay information. To quantify the level
of balance in the connectivity of individual nodes, Figure
9(a) plots the summary distribution of the ratio of followers
to friends (using boxplots) for diﬀerent group of users based
on their number of followers in our most recent snapshot
(LCC-Nov). This ﬁgure demonstrates that only low degree
nodes (with less than 100 followers) exhibit some balance
between their number of followers and friends. Otherwise,
the number of friends among G+ users grows much slower
than the number of followers.

We calculate the percentage of bidirectional relationships
for a node u, called BR(u), as expressed in Equation 1 where
Friend(u) and Follower(u) represent the set of friends and
followers for u, respectively. In essence, BR(u) is simply the
ratio of the total number of bidirectional relationships over
the total number of unique relationships for user u.

Table 6: Summary of path length and diameter char-
acteristics for G+, Facebook and Twitter

Figure 9(b) presents the summary distribution of BR(u) for
diﬀerent groups of G+ users in LCC the based on their num-
ber of followers using the LCC-Nov snapshot. The results for
other recent LCC snapshots are very similar. As expected,
popular users (> 10k followers) have a very small percent-
age of bidirectional relationships. As the number of followers
decreases, the fraction of bidirectional relationships slowly
increases until it reaches around 40% for low-degree users (<
1K followers). In short, even low degree users that maintain
a balanced connectivity, do not reciprocate more than 40%
of their relationships. Our inspection of 5% of LCC users
who reciprocate more than 90% of their edges revealed that
90% of them maintain less than 3 friends/followers and less
than 5% of them have any public posts. These results col-
lectively suggest that G+ users reciprocate a small fraction
of their relationships which is often done by very low degree
users with no activity.
Clustering Coeﬃcient: Figure 10 depicts the summary
distribution of the undirected version of the clustering co-
eﬃcient (CC) among G+ users in diﬀerent LCC snapshots.
This ﬁgure clearly illustrates that during the roughly one
year period from Dec 2011 to Nov 2012, the CC among the
bottom 90% of users remained below 0.5 and continuously
decreases. On the other hand, the CC for the top 10% of
In essence, the G+ structure
users has been very stable.
has become less clustered as new users joined the LCC over
the one year period. A similar trend in cluster coeﬃcient
has been recently reported for a popular Chinese OSN [49]
that indicates that such an evolution in the CC might be
driven by underlying social forces rather than features of
the OSNs. We also notice that the distribution of the CC
among G+ users exhibits only minor changes between Aug
and Nov 2012 which is another sign of stability in the con-
nectivity features of G+ network. Compared to Twitter
network where the CC is less than 0.3 for 90% of users, G+
is still more clustered. Furthermore, using the approxima-
tion presented in [39], we conclude that just 1% of the nodes
in a complete Facebook snapshot collected in May 2011 [46]
have a CC larger than 0.2 in comparison with the 16% and
30% in Twitter and G+ (using LCC-Nov snapshot). In sum-
mary, as the population of G+ has grown, its connectivity
has become less clustered but it is still the most clustered
network compared to Twitter and Facebook.

Path Length: Figure 11 plots the probability distribution
function for the pairwise path length between nodes in dif-
ferent LCC snapshots for G+ and a snapshot of Twitter
(TW-Con). We observe that roughly 97-99% of the pairwise
paths between G+ users are between 2 to 7 hops long and
roughly 68-74% of them are 4 or 5 hops. The diameter of the
G+ graph has increased from 17 hops (in April) to 22 hops
(in November of 2012). The two visibly detectable changes
in this feature of the G+ graph as a result of its growth are: a
small decrease in typical path length (from April to Novem-
ber) and the increase of its diameter in the same period.
Table 6 summarizes the average and mode path length, the
diameter and the eﬃcient diameter [38] (i.e., 90 percentile
of pairwise path lengths) for the G+ network (using LCC-
Nov), Twitter (using TW-Con) and a Facebook snapshot
from [23]. We observe that G+ and Facebook exhibit sim-
ilar average (and mode) path length but Facebook has a
longer diameter. One explanation is the fact that the size of
Facebook network is roughly one order of magnitude larger
than G+ LCC. Twitter has the shortest average and mode
path length and diameter among the three. We conjecture
that this diﬀerence is due to the lack of restriction in the
maximum number of friends that leads to many shortcuts
in the network as Twitter users connect to a larger number
of friends.
Relating User Activity & Connectivity: We also ana-
lyzed the correlation between the connectivity and activ-
ity of individual users in the LCC. Our results reveal a
strong positive correlation between the popularity of a user
(i.e., number of followers) and the user’s post rate. The post
rate of individual users exhibit a weaker correlation with the
number of friends. Further details on all of our analysis can
be found in our related technical report [31].

In summary, our analysis on the evolution of LCC con-
nectivity led to the following key ﬁndings: (i) As the size of
LCC signiﬁcantly increased over the past year, all connec-
tivity features of LCC have initially evolved but have become
rather stable in recent months despite its continued growth.
(ii) Only low degree and non-active users may reciprocate
a moderate fraction of their relationships. (iii) Many key
features of connectivity for G+ network (e.g., degree distri-
bution, fraction of bidirectional relationships) have striking
similarity with the Twitter network and very diﬀerent from

491the Facebook network. These connectivity features collec-
tively suggest that G+ is primarily used for message propa-
gation similar to Twitter rather than pairwise users interac-
tions similar to Facebook.

7. RELATED WORK
OSN characterization: The importance of OSNs has mo-
tivated researchers to characterize diﬀerent aspects of the
most popular OSNs. The graph properties of Facebook [46,
23], Twitter [37, 26] and other popular OSNs [42] have been
carefully analyzed. Note that all these studies use a single
snapshot of the system to conduct their analysis, instead we
analyze the evolution of the G+ graph over a period of one
year. In addition, some other works leverage passive (e.g.,
click streams) [24, 45] or active [48, 32] measurements to an-
alyze the user activity in diﬀerent popular OSNs. These pa-
pers are of diﬀerent nature than ours since they use smaller
datasets to analyze the behaviour of individual users.
In-
stead, we use a much larger dataset to analyze the evolution
of the aggregate public activity along time as well as the
skewness of the contribution overall activity across users in
G+. Finally, few works have also analyzed users’ informa-
tion sharing through their public attributes in OSNs such as
Facebook [41].
Evolution of OSN properties: Previous studies have sep-
arately studied the evolution of the relative size of the net-
work elements for speciﬁc OSNs (Flickr and Yahoo 360) [36],
the growth of an OSN and the evolution of its graph proper-
ties [40, 22, 49, 28, 29, 43] or the evolution of the interactions
between users [34] and users’ availability [25]. In this paper,
instead of looking at a speciﬁc aspect, we perform a com-
prehensive analysis to study the evolution of diﬀerent key
aspects of G+ namely, the system growth, the representa-
tive of the diﬀerent network elements, the LCC connectivity
and activity properties and the level of information sharing.
Google+ Characterization: G+ has recently attracted
the attention of the research community. Mango et al. [39]
use a BFS-based crawler to retrieve a snapshot of the G+
LCC between Nov and Dec 2011. They analyze the graph
properties, the public information shared by users and the
geographical characteristics and geolocation patterns of G+.
[44] leverage Google’s site-maps to gather
Schiberg et al.
G+ user IDs and then crawl these users’ information.
In
particular, they study the growth of the system and users
connectivity over a period of one and a half months between
Sep and Oct 2011. Unfortunately, as acknowledged by the
authors the described technique was anymore available after
Oct 2011. Furthermore, the authors also analyze the level
of public information sharing and the geographical proper-
ties of users and links in the system. Finally, Gong et al.
[30] use a BFS-based crawler to obtain several snapshots of
the G+ LCC in its ﬁrst 100 days of existence. Using this
dataset the authors study the evolution of the main graph
properites of G+ LCC in its early stage. Our work presents
a broader focus than these previous works since in addi-
tion to the graph topology and the information sharing we
also analyze (for ﬁrst time) the evolution of both the public
activity and the representativeness of the diﬀerent network
elements. Furthermore, our study of the graph topology evo-
lution considers a 1 year window between Dec 2011 and Nov
2012 when the network is signiﬁcantly larger and presents
important diﬀerences to its early status that is the focus of
the previous works. In another interesting, but less related

work, Kairam et al.
[35] use the complete information for
more than 60K G+ users (provided by G+ administrators)
and a survey including answers from 300 users to under-
stand the selective sharing in G+. Their results show that
public activity represents 1/3 of the G+ activity and that an
important fraction of users make public posts frequently. Fi-
nally, other papers have studied the video telephony system
of G+ [47], the public circles feature [27] and the collabora-
tive privacy management approaches [33].
8. CONCLUSION

This paper examines the key features of G+ network and
their evolution during the ﬁrst year of G+ operation. We
conduct large scale measurement on G+ and collect some of
the largest public datasets on any OSN to date to character-
ize connectivity, activity and information sharing across G+
users along with their evolution over a one year period. We
develop an eﬃcient technique to collect random samples of
G+ user. This in turn enables us to determine the relative
size of key components (i.e.LCC, partitions, singletons) of
G+ network.

We show that while the size of LCC component of G+
has grown at a high rate (200K user per day), the relative
size of LCC has decreased with time. Our investigations
reveal that a signiﬁcant fraction of new G+ users appear
to be implicitly added by Google while they register for
other Google services. Furthermore, the main connectiv-
ity features of LCC have become relatively stable in recent
months which suggests that the G+ network has reached a
steady state. We show that these stable connectivity fea-
tures of LCC component of G+ have a striking similarity
with Twitter but are very diﬀerent from Facebook. This
similarity indicates that users use G+ for message propaga-
tion similar to Twitter rather than pairwise user interaction
like Facebook. In terms of user activity, even LCC users are
not actively engaged in G+ network. The contribution of
user activity in terms of posting is skewed among LCC users
(i.e.10% of users are responsible for 80% of posts) and user
reactions to activities is an order of magnitude more skewed
(i.e.1% of users generate 80% of reactions to all posts). Our
ﬁndings collectively demonstrate that in the current OSN
marketplace with two dominant players, namely Facebook
and Twitter, a new OSN such as G+ might be able to at-
tract a rather signiﬁcant number of users to become part of
the network (i.e.connect to its LCC). However, it is much
more challenging to get these users meaningfully engaged in
the system.
