ABSTRACT
Peer-to-peer networks are the most popular mechanism for
the criminal acquisition and distribution of child pornogra-
phy (CP). In this paper, we examine observations of peers
sharing known CP on the eMule and Gnutella networks,
which were collected by law enforcement using forensic tools
that we developed. We characterize a year’s worth of net-
work activity and evaluate diﬀerent strategies for prioritizing
investigators’ limited resources. The highest impact research
in criminal forensics works within, and is evaluated under,
the constraints and goals of investigations. We follow that
principle, rather than presenting a set of isolated, exploratory
characterizations of users.

First, we focus on strategies for reducing the number of
CP ﬁles available on the network by removing a minimal
number of peers. We present a metric for peer removal that
is more eﬀective than simply selecting peers with the largest
libraries or the most days online. Second, we characterize six
aggressive peer subgroups, including: peers using Tor, peers
that bridge multiple p2p networks, and the top 10% of peers
contributing to ﬁle availability. We ﬁnd that these subgroups
are more active in their traﬃcking, having more known CP
and more uptime, than the average peer. Finally, while in
theory Tor presents a challenge to investigators, we observe
that in practice oﬀenders use Tor inconsistently. Over 90%
of regular Tor users send traﬃc from a non-Tor IP at least
once after ﬁrst using Tor.

raphy (CP)1. Investigating CP traﬃcking online is critical to
law enforcement because it is the only eﬀective proactive2
method of ﬁnding persons, known as contact oﬀenders, who
directly and physically abuse children. A previous study
found that 16% of investigations of CP possession ended
with discovering contact oﬀenders [29]. These investigations
have two primary goals: to stop the distribution of CP; and
to catch child molesters and help children that are being
victimized, often by family members.

Numerous studies of p2p networks have explored the avail-
ability, performance, and traﬃc characteristics of ﬁle sharing.
Unfortunately, no study of copyrighted movies or music pro-
vides any assistance to law enforcement seeking to arrest CP
perpetrators, discover sexually abused children, and inhibit
the trade of images of exploitation. These past works are
neither performed within nor evaluated under the constraints
and goals of criminal investigations. The study we present
in this paper is based on methodology suﬃcient for court
scrutiny3, makes speciﬁc recommendations for law enforce-
ment strategy, and provides an empirical characterization
suitable for goals ranging from informing sentencing hearings
to setting national enforcement priorities.

The fundamental problem faced daily by CP investigators
is triage [28]. Over a one year period, we observed over
1.8 million distinct peers on eMule and over 700,000 peers on
Gnutella, from over 100 countries, sharing hundreds of thou-
sands of ﬁles veriﬁed as CP. We observed that the majority
of CP ﬁles are shared by a relatively small set of aggressive
users, but a smaller set of ﬁles are shared so redundantly
that their daily availability is guaranteed. While most CP
ﬁles are only available for a short amount of time (only about
30% are available for more than 10 days of the year), there
are at least tens of thousands of unique CP ﬁles available
on p2p networks for download each day. These quantities
cannot be addressed by investigators in an ad hoc fashion.
Accordingly, we examine (i) methods of target selection
designed to reduce content availability (an NP-hard problem);
and (ii) an empirical justiﬁcation for focusing on subgroups of

1These are not “sexting” crimes by late teens: 21% of CP
possessors have images depicting sexual violence to children
such as bondage, rape, and torture; 28% have images of
children younger than 3 years old [29].
2This method is proactive in that law enforcement is not
waiting for someone, a third-party or the victim (if old enough
to speak), to come forward and report the abuse.
3The data in this study formed the basis of 2,227 search
warrant aﬃdavits.

631peers that are the most aggressive, in terms of their duration
and scope of activity, volume of shared content, or attempts
to escape attribution. Our key contributions are as follows.

• We propose and evaluate three strategies for priori-
tizing law enforcement resources in investigating CP
traﬃcking. We conclude that removing peers with the
largest contributions (a weighted measure of days of
uptime and ﬁles made available) is most eﬀective, but
with Pareto-like diminishing returns.

• We examine subgroups of aggressive peers, such as
peers seen using Tor, peers on multiple p2p networks,
and four other subgroups. We ﬁnd that all appear to
be more active in their traﬃcking, having more CP
ﬁles and more uptime than the average peer sharing
CP. These aggressive subgroups deserve priority in
investigation over millions of other potential targets.

• We ﬁnd that oﬀenders using Tor use it inconsistently.
Over 60% of linkable user sessions send traﬃc from
non-Tor IPs at least once after ﬁrst using Tor, thus
removing its protection; over 90% of sessions observed
on three or more days fail likewise. This result not
only speaks broadly to the failure of Tor in practice; it
shows that, fortunately, investigators need not employ
complicated, theoretical attacks on many Tor users that
share CP.

• We examine our dataset for evidence of users purposely
aliasing as multiple peers on the network to hide their
actions. We ﬁnd little evidence, on a day-to-day basis,
to suggest that users are changing their application-
level identiﬁers but keeping their libraries.

Our ﬁndings are based on a partnership with over 2,000
U.S. law enforcement oﬃcers nationwide to collect data on
CP traﬃcking. To enable our study, we have built several
tools for conducting forensically valid investigation of these
crimes. All investigators completed multi-day trainings on
our tools, and collected evidence with the expectation that a
court would examine the data. These tools are now in daily
use in all U.S. states and several other countries. As a result,
thousands of persons, many of whom had directly abused
children, have been arrested for these crimes.

2. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

The highest impact research in criminal forensics works
within, and is evaluated under, the constraints and goals
of investigations.
In this paper, we follow that principle,
rather than presenting a set of isolated, exploratory charac-
terizations of users. In this section, we review the U.S. legal
constraints on criminal investigation based on applications
of our work.

Most importantly, our work is in the context of the pre-
warrant (plain view) phase of investigations, prior to any
arrest. Actions by investigators are curtailed by the Fourth
Amendment and related jurisprudence. These require that
pre-warrant, investigators acquire only evidence in plain view
and therefore not violate a person’s expectation of privacy
(see Katz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967)). Recent cases have
supported the view that logging CP sharing activities on p2p
networks does not violate any plain view restrictions because
they are open forums; see U.S. v. Borowy, 595 F.3d 1045
(9th Cir. 2010) and U.S. v. Gabel, 2010 WL 3927697.

The goal of the pre-warrant phase is not to make an arrest;
it is to obtain a judicially issued search warrant, granted

only once the probable cause (PC) standard is met. PC is a
qualitative measure often deﬁned as meeting a “fair probabil-
ity” that further evidence will be found in the location to be
searched; see U.S. v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1 (1989). In criminal
investigations of the type we consider, search warrants must
specify this location, and not a person. This process is in
stark contrast to the civil process used in copyright infringe-
ment lawsuits, where the standards of evidence are lower,
and Fourth Amendment protections do not apply.

Arrests in these criminal cases are typically not based on
the network-acquired evidence. They are based on the fruits
of the search and the person identiﬁed as possessing the
contraband materials. There is no notion of a false positive
of a person during a search; only that the search itself was
barren of evidence. Investigators and warrant-issuing judges
prefer to minimize as much as possible the number of such
ineﬀectual searches, but they are not impermissible.

Because of the plain view mandate, there is nothing in our
data collection methodology that is secret or hidden. We
have no special agreement with law enforcement, other than
their identiﬁcation, by hash value, of known ﬁles of interest.
We log and analyze only what is available to any member of
the public and research community.

Finally, we note that our work follows a forensics model and
not the traditional security attacker model. Our techniques
can be applied very successfully even though there exist many
ways to defeat them. But as we show, many people do not
attempt to hide. We identiﬁed over 1.8 million eMule GUIDs
(globally unique identiﬁers), with many sharing multiple CP
ﬁles. Each such shared ﬁle matches a list of known CP,
identiﬁed by a cryptographic hash. Not one of the 1.8 million
took the time to change a single bit of the ﬁle and thus
the hash. Why? We can only speculate, but changing the
ﬁle hash serves little purpose when the ﬁle names already
contain sexually explicit terms, intentionally named for easy
discovery by other peers.

3. FORENSIC MEASUREMENT

This study is based upon the analysis of a large number of
observations of CP ﬁles on p2p networks, and the behavior
of the peers that share them. In this section, we describe the
sources of these datasets and provide salient details relevant
to our analysis. In Section 7, we identify sources of bias in
the data and potential limitations of our study.

Most previous studies of p2p networks have taken place
over just several days [7, 8], several weeks [12], or a few
months [6, 17, 21, 25]; our study is comprised of thousands
of observations per day for a full year. This duration is
especially critical in the context of criminal investigations;
scientiﬁc studies of crime are often submitted as supporting
facts during trial and sentencing.

Our focus is on ﬁles of interest (FOI), which include CP
images, as well as stories, child erotica, and other collections
that are strongly associated with this crime. We logged only
content with hash values matching, by cryptographic hash,
a list put together by law enforcement by visual inspection.

Background. This paper is based on data collected with the
help of national and international law enforcement4. Starting

4We detail lessons learned from working with law enforcement
and the basics of digital forensics research elsewhere [28].

Table 1: All datasets are observations of CP activity only, but IRC and Ares data do not contain information about ﬁles or GUIDs. Except
when otherwise stated, a record corresponds to a law enforcement observation and contains date, time, IP address, application-level
identiﬁer, geographic location as determined by an IP geolocation database, and a ﬁle hash.

in January 2009, we began deploying a set of forensic tools
to investigators in the U.S. and internationally for online
investigation of p2p CP traﬃcking.

Prior to our collaborative eﬀorts, the standard method for
online CP investigation was to make isolated cases: leads
were not shared among agencies or oﬃcers, other than by
phone or email. Oﬃcers leveraged their own experience to
prioritize suspects.

Tools. Our suite of tools, called RoundUp [14], has enabled
seamless sharing of plain view observations of online CP and
associated activities on various ﬁlesharing networks. The
shared data, collected in order to make these cases, provide
each investigator with a longitudinal view of CP oﬀenders
and provide a method of triage for selecting targets for
further investigation; and of course, the data enable this
study. Because over 2,000 investigators have been trained
on our tool to date, and because it is in use by hundreds of
investigators daily, the aggregate set of observations we have
used for this study is incredibly detailed. The tools are still
in use, and currently, law enforcement execute approximately
150 search warrants nationwide per month based on data
collected using our tools. We do not, however, present search
warrant or arrest data in this study5.

Datasets. Our datasets, summarized in Table 1, include
law enforcement observations from Gnutella and eMule p2p
networks. The Gnutella and eMule datasets span a one-year
period from October 1, 2010 to September 18, 2011. Each
record in these datasets corresponds to a law enforcement
observation of a particular peer making available one or
more FOI, and minimally contains date, time, IP address,
application-level identiﬁer, geographic location as determined
by an IP geolocation database, and a ﬁle hash.

Most ﬁle sharing protocols include an application-level
identiﬁer unique to an installation of the application. In both
Gnutella and eMule, these identiﬁers are persistent across
users’ sessions, and are referred to as GUIDs (globally unique
identiﬁers). Peers on these networks are uniquely identiﬁed
by their GUID, and we use peer and GUID interchangeably
to identify unique running instances of the corresponding
p2p software.

All FOI are uniquely identiﬁed using hash values; law
enforcement manually classify ﬁles as FOI from a variety of
sources, such as post-arrest forensic analyses. An enormous
number of such FOI are shared on Gnutella and eMule.
Respectively, there are 139,604 and 29,458 known FOI shared
by 775,941 and 1,895,804 GUIDs. Our tool searched only
for FOI in a list containing about 384,000 entries; this list
was updated several times over the course of this study.

5Our study’s procedures were approved by our Institutional
Review Boards.

It is a small sample: the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children reports reviewing more than 60 million
child pornography images and videos6. As such, our work
presents only a lower bound on the amount of activity present
in these networks.

In a limited fashion, we use two other datasets. Our IRC
dataset, based on a more recent tool that we developed,
covers a four-month period from June to September 2011.
The IRC dataset is a log of IP addresses that were involved in
public activity related to the sexual exploitation of children
in public chatrooms; no ﬁle observations are in this dataset.
We also use a dataset of CP-related activity on the Ares
p2p network7 collected using a tool we did not write, but
collected by the same law enforcement oﬃcers responsible
for all data in this paper. The Ares dataset contains only
IP addresses and has no information about ﬁles shared, but
addresses were only logged for peers that shared known FOI.

Other Details. Gnutella allows a peer to be browsed and
thus investigators can enumerate all ﬁles shared by peers.
Our Gnutella Browse dataset consists entirely of peer browses
and includes all ﬁles a peer is sharing, not just FOI. Some
Gnutella peers cannot be browsed; we collected only FOI data
from these peers. eMule does not permit browses. Regardless,
each of these datasets includes only peers that share one or
more FOI; peers without FOI were not logged.

We draw a distinction between a time-limited view of a
peer’s shared ﬁles and the set of all ﬁles with which a given
peer was ever observed. We deﬁne a GUID’s library to be the
set of ﬁles that were observed being shared by that GUID
on a given day. A GUID’s corpus is the set of all ﬁles shared
by that GUID over the entire duration of the study. In both
cases, we typically only include FOI, but we make it clear
when a corpus or library includes non-FOI observed as the
result of a browse.

4. AVAILABILITY AND RESILIENCE

In investigating the traﬃcking of CP on p2p networks, the
goal of law enforcement is to prioritize criminals whose arrest
will have the greatest impact. But the strategy to achieve
this goal depends upon the impact desired: ﬁnding contact
oﬀenders who go otherwise unreported, ﬁnding those who
create new CP, and decreasing the availability of FOI on
the network are all priorities. In this section, we focus on
strategies for reducing the availability of FOI.

Eﬀective CP removal strategies are especially important
as a means to prioritize law enforcement’s limited resources
and time. After online evidence is collected, days or weeks

Gnutella, and similarly for the “Common on eMule” line.

of oﬀ-line processes are required in each case until an arrest
is made. Additional resources are required to go to trial. It
is infeasible for investigators to arrest all users sharing CP
and remove all FOI. Investigators need a triage strategy for
deciding upon which small fraction of online leads to act.

An enormous set of perpetrators are active every day
around the world. Even with unlimited resources, U.S. law
enforcement can only partially impact ﬁle availability. Our
results, discussed below, suggest the need for a coordinated
international eﬀort.

4.1 FOI Redundancy and Availability

Before we further discuss the implications of removing ﬁles,
we characterize the redundancy and availability of FOI on
Gnutella and eMule.

4.1.1 File Redundancy Across GUIDs

Many FOI on Gnutella and eMule are not widely redundant
among GUIDs within the same network. Figure 1 shows the
relative redundancy of FOI, which is the number of GUIDs
that possess and make available each ﬁle. The distribution
is presented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF),
which shows on the y-axis the fraction of FOI that are shared
by at most x GUIDs. For example, 90% of ﬁles on Gnutella
were shared by at most 20 GUIDs; 99% of ﬁles were shared
by at most 1,167 GUIDs; and 99.9% of ﬁles were shared by
at most 9,129 GUIDs.

Figure 1 also shows the relative redundancy for the subset
of FOI appearing on both networks. The set of ﬁles common
to both networks is signiﬁcantly more redundantly shared on
each network than the set of all ﬁles on each network. There is
a high degree of FOI overlap among the two networks: 26,136
of the FOI on the eMule network (nearly 89%) were also
seen on the Gnutella network, and 97% of Gnutella GUIDs
were observed with at least one ﬁle that can be found on the
eMule network. The overall low redundancy of most ﬁles
suggests the strategy of prioritizing the investigation of users
who possess a large amount of less redundant FOI in order

to remove it from the network and prevent its proliferation.
An easily intuited proxy for this measure is to target GUIDs
who possess large corpora. Since most FOI are relatively less
redundant, the GUIDs with the largest libraries likely have
the most FOI with low redundancy.

4.1.2 File Availability Across Days

We say a ﬁle is available on a given day if at least one peer
is sharing that ﬁle on that day. This approach is simple in
that it does not take into account bandwidth and reachability
considerations, which are diﬃcult to measure globally. We
do not expect this deﬁnition to limit the applicability of our
results, as the assumption of high bandwidth and reachability
is conservative from the perspective of law enforcement.

Figure 2 plots the availability of FOI as a CDF on a semi-
log scale. Gnutella ﬁles tend to have lower availability than
eMule, with 80% of ﬁles available for more than one day;
about 30% are available for more than 10 days; and about
5% of ﬁles are available for more than 100 days. Generally,
ﬁles that are available for a single day are unique to a speciﬁc
GUID; ﬁles that tend to have longer availability are possessed
by many GUIDs, not all of whom are online on a given day.
Again we see that the ﬁles that are common to both networks
are more available than is typical on each individual network:
about 30% of these common ﬁles are available for more than
100 days. We have also calculated that on a daily basis, an
average of 9,712 distinct ﬁles are available, with a peak of
32,020 ﬁles during our study.

4.2 Law Enforcement Strategy

Our law enforcement model is as follows. Investigators
have a global, historical view of GUIDs and their corpora,
including known FOI and other ﬁles. Investigators look to
reduce FOI availability, by arresting the users that corre-
spond to peers and removing their corpora from the network.
Investigators aim to remove ﬁles from the network completely.
Content can be removed from these networks only by

Figure 3: The remaining fraction of FOI available at least one

heuristics:
random, number of days observed, corpus size, and
contribution to ﬁle availability on Gnutella and eMule. We re-
moved the top 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 percent of GUIDs according to
each heuristic. In Gnutella, the Corpus and Contribution heuristics
achieve equal results when 0.113% of GUIDs are removed. Also
shown is the impact of removing 100% of peers with 10 or fewer
FOI, and 100% of peers in the U.S.

arresting users and taking their shared libraries oﬄine, as the
protocols and implementations inhibit falsifying or polluting
content. Our goal is to ﬁnd out which peers should be
removed such that we minimize the number of ﬁles that are
available at least one day.

In Appendix A of our technical report we show that this
problem is NP-Hard [9]. Here, we evaluate four greedy heuris-
tics aimed at reducing the availability of CP by removing
peers. Our evaluation consists of removing subsets of peers
from the data and examining the eﬀect on availability. Specif-
ically, we examine the following heuristics: (i) removing peers
that were observed most often, i.e., largest number of days
observed; (ii) removing peers with the largest corpus size;
(iii) removing peers with the largest contribution to avail-
ability (as deﬁned below); and (iv) removing peers selected
randomly, as a baseline. For an arbitrary ﬁle on an arbitrary
day, n peers possess that ﬁle. We say that each peer provides
a ﬁle-contribution of 1
n th of that ﬁle. A peer’s contribution
to ﬁle availability is the sum of the ﬁle-contributions of the
ﬁles in their corpus over the duration of the study.

An alternative measure of availability is daily redundancy,
the number of peers that share a ﬁle on a speciﬁc day. The
algorithm to optimally reduce the maximum redundancy over
all ﬁles shared is simple: remove the peers with the largest
corpus size ﬁrst. It is unclear that minimizing redundancy,
unless it is to zero (equivalent to unavailability), is useful or
eﬀective. To evaluate the eﬀect of reducing redundancy to a
small value, we would require reachability, bandwidth, and
propagation models of the underlying p2p overlays. Thus,
we do not consider daily redundancy further.

4.2.1 Comparison of the Efﬁciency of Heuristics

Figure 3 compares the eﬀectiveness of each of the above
heuristics. Interestingly, removing the peers that were seen

the most often has almost no eﬀect on the availability of FOI.
Removing peers by either contribution or corpus size is most
eﬀective; these measures are correlated, so their similarity in
performance is unsurprising.

The vast majority of ﬁles are shared only by a relatively
small set of proliﬁc GUIDs. Consider Gnutella (similar trends
hold for eMule): If we remove the top 0.01% of 775,941
GUIDs as determined by corpus size, only 59% of the known
FOI remain available in the network. In other words, 41%
of the unique ﬁles on the network are made available by a
group of only about 80 GUIDs. The top 0.01% have 3,242
distinct FOI on average, with the top peer possessing about
25,000 FOI. Most of these ﬁles, however, are only available
for a relatively short amount of time; as Figure 2 shows, only
28% are available for more than 10 days during our study.
Some of this is due to the relatively low number of days these
high-contributing GUIDs were observed; this also explains
the failure of the observed days heuristic. These proliﬁc
GUIDs have a worldwide presence. Removing them requires
tremendous multi-national cooperation as we discuss below.

4.2.2

Impact of Geography on Availability

Our data are mostly based on the eﬀorts of U.S. law
enforcement, and the ﬁles they are looking for are arguably
tuned to U.S. perpetrators. As law enforcement agents are
limited by jurisdiction, the locational diversity of these users
provides a resistance to the straightforward approach of
prioritizing them. Only a small majority of top Gnutella
GUIDs (by corpus size)—57 out of 100—are located in the
U.S. The rightmost bar (“All U.S.”) in Figure 3 shows the
reduction in availability if we restrict our removal to U.S.
GUIDs (that is, GUIDs with an IP located in the U.S.) only.
Note that we remove all such GUIDS in our analysis, a
clearly infeasible approach in practice. Just 30% of ﬁles are
unavailable (internationally) after removing all GUIDs in the
U.S.; removing just the top 0.01% internationally (a group of
about 80 GUIDs) has a similar eﬀect, suggesting the utility
of a coordinated international approach.

Within the U.S., the problem is similarly large in scope.
The top 5% of GUIDs in the U.S. comprises a set of 14,410
GUIDs, each with a corpus of at least 40 known FOI. Due
to the weeks of manual eﬀort required for each arrest, the
limited resources in the U.S. allow for 3,100 arrests per year
for both oﬄine and online oﬀenses [27].

4.2.3

Impact of Low-Sharing GUIDs on Availability
A large portion of GUIDs have comparatively few ﬁles. As
shown in Figure 4, about 82% have 10 or fewer FOI. There
are several reasons peers may appear to have few ﬁles. They
may have ﬁles that are CP, but are not yet known to be
FOI. They may be downloading FOI and not subsequently
sharing them. They may have downloaded the ﬁles incidental
to other activities. Finally, they may simply be sharing a
smaller library. We expected removal of such low-sharing
users to impact ﬁle availability signiﬁcantly, since very many
peers possess few ﬁles. Contrary to our expectations, removal
of these GUIDs sharing few ﬁles has essentially no eﬀect on ﬁle
availability, as shown in the second-rightmost bar in Figure 3
(“≤ 10 FOI”). This result provides further evidence that
ﬁle availability depends primarily on those GUIDs with the
largest corpora, though it does not consider the contribution
to redundancy that these low-sharing GUIDs provide.

5. COMPARING AGGRESSIVE PEERS

In Section 4, we show that strategies for removing con-
tent from the entire ecosystem must target oﬀenders from
all countries.
In the absence of a uniﬁed eﬀort—and no
such collaboration exists—investigators need a triage strat-
egy. In this section, we characterize triage metrics for local
investigators. Ideally, investigators would target the most
dangerous oﬀenders: those that are personally, physically
abusing children. Unfortunately, such information is typically
not available until months or years after arrest [26].

In lieu of that ideal, local investigators can target peers
that are the most aggressive oﬀenders: peers that exhibit
greater evidence of intent [11] beyond the average case, which
is an important practical legal concern. This includes peers
such as those that are online for the longest duration and
share the largest number of FOI. Similarly, investigators
may target oﬀenders that are conduits between p2p network
communities (e.g., by sharing on both eMule and Gnutella),
or oﬀenders that seek to escape detection and justice by using
Tor or network relays.

We quantify the activity of six subgroups of aggressive
peers sharing FOI. We characterize the contribution of each
subgroup to the duration of CP availability and the amount
of CP content. The subgroups are: (i) the top 10% of GUIDs
sharing the largest corpora; (ii) the top 10% of GUIDs
seen sharing FOI the most number of days; (iii) the top
10% of GUIDs ranked by the contribution metric deﬁned in
Section 4.2; (iv) the set of GUIDs sharing FOI on at least
two p2p networks (linked by IP address); (v) GUIDs that
use a known Tor exit node; (vi) GUIDs sharing FOI that use
an IP address that we infer to be a non-Tor relay.

Our results show that all of these subgroups are more active
than a group that consists of all peers that we observed. The
exception is the subgroup of GUIDs using non-Tor relays, as

we explain below. The diﬀerences of each subgroup to the
set of all GUIDs are signiﬁcant (p < 0.001).

Below we provide characteristics of each subgroup, and
details of the behavior of each. For example, we show that
GUIDs using Tor to share FOI use Tor irregularly, and
therefore their true IP addresses are easily identiﬁable. Due
to space limitations, we omit Gnutella data from some graphs
where they largely correspond to the eMule data. The full
set of graphs are available in our technical report [9].

5.1 Peer Subgroups

The size of each subgroup is shown in Table 2. The size
of the top 10% by corpus and observed days subgroups are
slightly larger than 10%. This variability is due to ties in
the ranked lists of GUIDs. We include all such GUIDs to
avoid arbitrary tie-breaking.

5.1.1 Top 10% Groupings

Users can actively participate in p2p networks in two
primary ways: by contributing a large number of ﬁles or a
large amount of time. For example, one peer may share 100
ﬁles for a single day, and another may share a single ﬁle for
100 days. In the ﬁrst case, the content is large but other peers
have only a limited time to take advantage. In the second
case, the content is small but other peers will ﬁnd it easier
to gain access to the content. It is vital for investigators
to address both types of activity; the contribution metric
balances these two concerns.

For these reasons, we create three subgroups corresponding
to the 10% of GUIDs with the largest corpora of ﬁles (F ),
the 10% with the most days observed online (D), and the top
10% of GUIDs when ranked by the contribution metric (C).
There is substantial but not overwhelming overlap among
these subgroups. The overlap in Gnutella, as deﬁned by
Jaccard’s index, J(A, B) = |A∩B|
|A∪B| , is J(C, F ) = 0.51 and
J(C, D) = 0.28; the eMule subgroups overlap similarly.

ing Tor IPs and private IPs. A small but signiﬁcant set of IPs were
seen across multiple networks, indicating particularly active users.

5.1.2 Multi-Network Peers

Law enforcement are interested in users that are active
on multiple p2p networks. Such users are more aggressive
in terms of assisting in the distribution and availability of
content to two communities, possibly acting as a bridge. We
identify the set of GUIDs in Gnutella that are active in
another network by ﬁnding all IP addresses in our Gnutella
dataset that also appear in any of our eMule, Ares, or IRC
datasets, and correspondingly in eMule for those that appear
in any of the Gnutella, Ares, or IRC datasets. We refer to
GUIDs in these sets as multi-network GUIDs.

The total number of IPs addresses, private IPs8, and IPs
used by GUIDs that also used known Tor exit nodes that
we observed for each of these networks is shown in Table 3.
Generally, private IPs are the result of sub-optimally or
misconﬁgured end-user applications, as opposed to indicating
privacy awareness. In contrast, Tor use indicates privacy-
aware users. Table 4 shows the size of each pairwise network
overlap. For all such intersections, we ﬁrst remove private IPs
and Tor exit nodes (as listed in the Tor consensus ﬁles9). Of
all network pairs, the Gnutella-eMule overlap is the largest.
The union of all three intersections comprises our 84,925
GUID multi-network subgroup for Gnutella. We perform a
similar calculation for eMule, resulting in 147,904 GUIDs.

5.1.3 Peers that Use Tor

Peers that use Tor are of interest to law enforcement
because they are actively masking their identities, thwarting
investigations of this crime. Tor does not ﬁlter application-
level data: GUIDs are passed through to investigators, and
thus appear in our dataset as well. We deﬁne a GUID as a
Tor GUID if it was ever observed as having an IP address
listed as a Tor exit node in the Tor consensus for the date
of the observation. When a Tor GUID’s IP is a known Tor
exit node we say that the GUID is using Tor. As Table 2
shows, this set is not large on either network: 3,666 GUIDs
for Gnutella and 16,290 GUIDs for eMule.

It is striking that the vast majority of Tor GUIDs do not
use Tor consistently, which makes it possible to detect their
true IP address. In Figure 5, we show the CDFs of overall
Tor usage. In both networks, only about a quarter of the
Tor GUIDs used Tor every time they were observed. More
signiﬁcantly, for these GUIDS, under 40% consistently use

8Private IP addresses are those which are non-routable on
the public Internet, self-assigned, or otherwise invalid, as
deﬁned by RFC 5735.

nodes on a daily basis; see https://metrics.torproject.

Fraction of Days Observed on Tor

Figure 5: CDF of Tor usage per GUID for eMule. GUIDs do
not use Tor consistently after ﬁrst being observed at a Tor IP.
Under 40% of Tor GUIDs consistently used Tor after ﬁrst being
observed using it. When considering only Tor GUIDs seen on >2
days (which comprise about 70% of all Tor GUIDs), the rate falls
to below 10%. The Gnutella data show similar characteristics.

Tor after their ﬁrst use of Tor.

When we examine these 40% of nodes that used Tor con-
sistently, we found that most were observed on the Gnutella
and eMule networks for only one or two days. Therefore,
we recomputed the distribution of Tor usage for the subset
of Tor GUIDs observed three or more days, which is over
70% of all Tor GUIDs. We again also computed the CDFs of
Tor usage after ﬁrst using Tor. The resulting CDFs are the
upper lines in Figure 5. In sum, over 90% of GUIDs using
Tor for more than two days on eMule and Gnutella are easily
linked back to a non-Tor IP address, one that is most likely
their real location.

This irregular use could be due to ignorance of how Tor
works, careless conﬁguration, or frustration with the lower
throughput of Tor. It is well known that Tor’s design does
not oﬀer technical protection to p2p users because it does
not hide identifying application-level data [16]. In contrast,
we provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence that Tor users do
not use the software consistently, even those with a strong
reason to so. Regardless of the quality of Tor’s security, this
evidence strongly suggests that its usability (its interface, its
eﬀects upon perceived speed, or some other factor) is lacking.
We conclude that the use of Tor, as observed in practice,
poses only a small hurdle to investigators. Reports by the
Tor developers that “Journalists use Tor to communicate
more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents”10 should give
one pause, as there is no evidence that those groups are
signiﬁcantly more or less tech-savvy than the users we study.

5.1.4

Peers that Use Suspected Relays

The ﬁnal subgroup we identify is a set of peers that are
using IPs that we suspect are relays (other than Tor exit
nodes). To create this subgroup, we ﬁrst collected the set
of non-Tor IP addresses used by GUIDs that also used a
Tor exit node. We discard the IPs that hosted fewer than
four GUIDs (267,035 in the case of Gnutella, and 1,671,419

for eMule), and we nominate the remaining IPs as potential
relays. Finally, we create the subgroup of relayed GUIDs as
the set of GUIDs seen using the potential relays. We cannot
validate these GUIDs as having deﬁnitely used relays; for
example, it may be the potential relays are IP addresses that
get reassigned frequently. However, we consider their use of
these shared IPs suﬃcient to deﬁne them as a distinct set.

5.2 A Comparison of Peer Behavior

There are substantive and statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences among the subgroups in terms of per-GUID corpora
and number of days observed. These diﬀerences can be seen
in Figure 6 and are summarized in Table 5. In particular, the
subgroups generally have a larger corpus size and more days
observed online than the set of all GUIDs. The three top-
10% subgroups show this eﬀect most strongly, but the Tor
subgroup and multi-network subgroups show similar eﬀects.
Notably, these latter two subgroups are selected indepen-
dently of corpus size and days online. This result conﬁrms a
hypothesis that tech-savvy groups, whether through Tor or
multi-network use, are more active.

The set of GUIDs in the top 10% contribution subgroup
represent a combination of the other aggressiveness metrics.
This result can be viewed by comparing CDFs in the ﬁgure, or

by comparing means in the table. For example, the top 10%
contribution subgroup’s mean corpus size is higher than the
top 10% observed, and its mean number of days observed is
higher than the top 10% corpus subgroup. The contribution
metric could easily be parameterized to weight observations
more heavily, though we do not show such results here.

The relayed subgroup in general has larger number of
FOI than the all group, and appears online more days on
average than the all group in eMule. However, the relayed
subgroup shows fewer days observed online than the all group
in the Gnutella network. This result suggests that either
this subgroup, as we’ve deﬁned it, is not particularly active,
or that our process for identifying non-Tor relays is faulty.
It may also be that the peers in the relayed subgroup are
more successful at aliasing themselves as diﬀerent GUIDs
that appear on the network fewer number of days each. In
the following section, we examine the general problem of user
aliasing in this data set.

6. ANALYSIS OF USER ALIASING

The relationship between p2p network GUIDs and real
users is not one-to-one in our dataset. In fact, it is possible
for a single user to correspond to multiple, distinct GUIDs.
We refer to this phenomenon as user aliasing, and for some

users it is intentional. In this section, we examine observable
user aliasing, and we also attempt to quantify its eﬀects upon
the analyses in the previous sections. In sum, we ﬁnd that
GUIDs that share at least three FOI any given day generally
have distinct libraries. In Gnutella, we can compare all ﬁles
shared by a GUID, and in that case users sharing a library
of at least two ﬁles are generally distinct on a given day. We
also ﬁnd little evidence to suggest users are changing their
GUIDs and then continuing to share the same library or a
portion of it later that day. Parallel results generally held
for eMule, though without the ability to browse eMule user
libraries, we are less certain of that result.

The true user aliasing rate in our data is unknowable
to us. However, the reasons for deliberate aliasing can be
enumerated: (i) if a user has two computers (or multiple
accounts on a single computer), each with an installation
of Gnutella, he will control two unique GUIDs; and (ii) a
user may reinstall or upgrade their p2p client on a single
computer or otherwise modify their GUID over time. We
have no way of detecting the ﬁrst case from only network
data; however, the second case can be detected if the user
does not alter what ﬁles they are sharing, as the ﬁle library
acts as a kind of signature for the user. It is this latter case
that we evaluate in the remainder of this section.

Most users, as identiﬁed by GUIDs, are seen with very
small libraries of a single ﬁle or two. This fact is illustrated
in Figure 4 in Section 4 (and in a week-by-week breakdown in
our technical report [9]). We posit that such small libraries
are not particularly diﬀerentiable. By excluding them, we
can determine a lower bound on the user aliasing of type (ii)
that may be occurring.

Analysis and Results. We computed day-to-day similari-
ties between Gnutella libraries to determine a lower bound
on user aliasing, or alternatively, an upper bound on the
number of unique libraries present in the dataset. Generally,
we found most libraries to be distinct.

Figure 7 shows a comparison of Gnutella GUID libraries,
plotting the fraction of GUIDs with libraries that are a
unique collection of ﬁles. In the upper portion of the ﬁgure,
a comparison is made of just the ﬁles of interest at each

Figure 8: Fraction of Gnutella GUIDs with a unique library, where
uniqueness is deﬁned as there being no other library with a simi-

Jaccard index, J(A, B) = |A∩B|
|A∪B| . On most days, 90% of libraries
have no more than half their ﬁles in common.

GUID; the lower portion compares all ﬁles in the library of
each GUID (from a Gnutella browse request). GUIDs that
have tens of ﬁles or more are easy to distinguish from others.
Figure 7 shows that in general, GUIDs with a single ﬁle
are easily aliased with other GUIDs with the same single
ﬁle: only about 58% of GUIDs have unique libraries on a
given day of our dataset. Among the 40% of Gnutella GUIDs
that have two or more FOI, over 95% have unique libraries.
Among the 25% of GUIDs with three or more FOI, over 99%
have distinct libraries.

Fewer aliases are present when comparisons can be made
of the complete libraries, as is possible with Gnutella browse
information, by including all ﬁles, not just FOI. This is
illustrated in the lower portion of Figure 7. Note that GUIDs
with a single FOI typically possess more than one ﬁle, and
thus they are more likely to be unique. Typically, GUIDs
seen with two or more ﬁles in their library had a unique
library about 95% of the time; GUIDs with three or more
ﬁles were unique over 99% of the time.

The above data suggest that we can treat GUIDs as

639uniquely distinguishable when their libraries contain at least
two FOI or when we consider all ﬁles that they share. The
analysis also suggests that users are rarely if ever changing
their GUID and appearing on the same day with the same
library. They would appear as aliases if so, and if this was
common, the fraction of unique libraries would be lower.

Based on a similar analysis, we also make the claim that
there is no compelling evidence that many users are changing
GUIDs appearing on the network that day and preserving
only most of their shared libraries. Figure 8 quantiﬁes the
uniqueness of partial and complete libraries using the Jaccard
index: J(A, B) = |A∩B|
|A∪B| . In the upper portion of Figure 8,
we see that for GUIDs with at least three FOI, approximately
90% of libraries have no more than half their ﬁles in common
on most days of our study. In the lower portion of Figure 8,
we compare all ﬁles in each GUID’s library, not just FOI.
Here we see on most days, 85% of libraries have no more
than 30% of their ﬁles in common.

A limitation of our calculations above is that we compare
GUIDs only within a day’s time. We haven’t computed
all-pairs, all-times equivalence or similarity among GUID
libraries across multiple days because the computation is too
lengthy to handle in a reasonable timescale for our dataset.

7. MEASUREMENT LIMITATIONS

The limitations of our study prevent us from providing
more than conservative lower bounds on the observable ac-
tivity of CP perpetrators. First, our set of known FOI is
likely biased towards ﬁles and ﬁlenames shared by traﬃckers
in the U.S. Traﬃckers in other countries are likely underesti-
mated by our study. Second, all of our records would ideally
be associated with a browse, in other words, a complete
listing of the peer’s current ﬁles. eMule does not support
browse functionality at all, and investigators do not browse
all Gnutella peers on all days. For example, a peer may be
identiﬁed as having ﬁle A on day 1 and day 3, but that ﬁle is
not seen on day 2 because the appropriate keyword or hash
search was not run. As a result, we may be underestimating
the amount of CP content possessed by each peer as well as
the number of days they are online. Third, peers that are
online more often are also more likely to be found using a
search. We might be underestimating the number of peers
that are rarely online and have few ﬁles.

On the other hand, one user might have one or more
installations of the p2p client software, with each installation
showing up as a diﬀerent GUID. Hence, the number of GUIDs
in these networks serves as a rough upper bound on the
number of users (for the FOI we knew about).

We also note that before, during, and after the collection of
the datasets we analyze, law enforcement were and are active
in investigating and arresting CP traﬃckers. We do not
know which peers were removed from the network, and we
do not take these removals into account in our analyses. The
speciﬁc metrics we report on do not rely on linking arrested
users to a search warrant and the outcome of a subsequent
trial.

8. RELATED WORK

Ecosystems & Underground Economies. Our work
is similar in theme to a body of work exploring economic
characteristics of network-based ecosystems [2, 5, 10, 13, 18].
For example, the irregular use of Tor by the peers in our

dataset might be explained by recent work showing that
users abandon privacy for short-term beneﬁts [1].

Content Availability in P2P Systems. A large body
of related work on p2p systems investigates availability, per-
formance, and issues related to the use of incentives [3, 4, 6,
15, 17, 19, 20, 30]. Unlike our work, these studies mostly focus
on understanding and analyzing the unique properties of p2p
networks and their users’ behavior, and do not speciﬁcally
target CP or separate aggressive subgroups.

CP Traﬃcking in P2P Systems. Prior studies of CP-
related traﬃcking on the Internet have a limited scope. They
are mostly indicative of the alarming presence of contraband
rather than comprehensively quantifying how the ﬁles are
being shared [8, 12, 21, 22]. All previous work focused on CP
(rather than copyright violations) is based on only CP-related
search terms rather than veriﬁed content [7, 8, 12, 23, 24].

The exception is our own prior work [14], where we an-
alyze CP-related activity on Gnutella during a ﬁve-month
period with no overlap with the study in this paper. In that
work, we show that the correspondence between IP addresses
and application-level identiﬁers is not one-to-one, and then
propose proactive methods of diﬀerentiating the end hosts.
In contrast, our focus in this work is on reducing availability
and characterizing peer behavior.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The criminal traﬃcking of CP on p2p networks is
widespread, with no easy answers for law enforcement looking
to curtail it. The diversity in peers’ location, the redundancy
of their libraries, and the many p2p networks, coupled with
limited law enforcement resources, dictate triage as a strat-
egy. Speciﬁcally, investigators should carefully choose peers
to investigate and remove from p2p networks.

We have shown that although naive approaches to
triage are ineﬀective and optimal approaches are NP-Hard,
tractable heuristics yield reasonable and useful results. Fur-
ther, the use of these heuristics are complemented by our
discovery of aggressive subgroups of CP traﬃckers, where
such groups correspond to aspects of the heuristics we identi-
ﬁed. Prioritizing enforcement in these groups is both eﬀective
and easily understandable by LE and policymakers alike.

Further, we have found no signiﬁcant evidence of users at-
tempting to hide by altering their visible ﬁle libraries: peers’
libraries are largely unique, strongly implying a unique user
behind each such library. Some users do use Tor, but sur-
prisingly, most do so inconsistently, making the investigation
of such users straightforward.

It is an open question as to whether network-observable
behaviors, such as interest in particular types of imagery,
correlate with oﬀ-line behaviors of interest to LE, such as
child molestation. In ongoing and future interdisciplinary
work, we will explore this interesting question.
