ABSTRACT
Modern Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games
(MMORPGs) provide lifelike virtual environments in which play-
ers can conduct a variety of activities including combat, trade, and
chat with other players. While the game world and the available ac-
tions therein are inspired by their ofﬂine counterparts, the games’
popularity and dedicated fan base are testaments to the allure of
novel social interactions granted to people by allowing them an
alternative life as a new character and persona. In this paper we
investigate the phenomenon of “gender swapping,” which refers to
players choosing avatars of genders opposite to their natural ones.
We report the behavioral patterns observed in players of Fairyland
Online, a globally serviced MMORPG, during social interactions
when playing as in-game avatars of their own real gender or gender-
swapped. We also discuss the effect of gender role and self-image
in virtual social situations and the potential of our study for improv-
ing MMORPG quality and detecting online identity frauds.

Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games, or MMORPGs
for short, are the most popular form of serious online gaming in the
Internet era. The illustrious developments in modern computing

dive into these games and enjoy their so-called “second life” in-
side a fantastical world. The most alluring aspect of MMORPGs
is that one can escape the dull, stressful reality and roam freely
while fulﬁlling their fantasies of an alternate identity. Interestingly
it is essential that the world in an MMORPG is still very realistic,
because it is the strangeness and novelty married with a sense of
familiar realism that makes these games popular and enjoyable to
millions of gamers worldwide [26]. In MMORPGs, as in real life,
the fun of real-time interactions with other players online—via con-
versation, commerce (trade), cooperation, and battle, as in real life
(some literal, others ﬁgurative)—are said to be the most attractive
feature.

From the research point of view, the realistic nature of the in-
teractions opens up the possibility of viewing the world inside an
MMORPG as a laboratory for observing individual and social be-
haviors of humans in as ﬁne details as the game design would allow.
In general, the proliferation of online arenas where people social-
ize, including MMORPGs, has given rise to formidable changes for
user behavior studies like psychology and sociology, where until re-
cently nearly all research on human behaviors have had to rely on
one-time self-reported data that were not easily replicable and were
relatively small in scale [18]. Large-scale detailed human dynam-
ics data found in online digital environments such as MMORPGs,
therefore, are fundamentally transforming the ﬁelds by allowing
researchers to easily overcome traditional constraints and conduct
studies on an unprecedented level of scale and precision.

MMORPGs are enticing to user behavior research as they pro-
vide, possibly more than any other online arena, a lifelike hyper-
realistic environment, where people can perform various social ac-
tions. For this reason MMORPG data are becoming increasingly
popular for examining the detailed patterns of people’s social be-
haviors; notable recent studies include an analysis of the structural
equivalence of the interaction networks in Pardus [27], and a com-
prehensive surgery of correlations among distinct kinds of interac-
tions (for example, friendship, party invitation, and trade) between
users of AION [26], both well-known global MMORPGs [1, 4].

The aforementioned works on MMORPG user data focus on the
global topology of the social networks constructed from players’
interaction logs. In such a network study, the complete set of in-
teractions is represented as a giant mathematical graph, in which
the players are the nodes and the interactions are the links connect-
ing the nodes. Naturally the players, the subjects of observation,

827and straight, gender–swapped and gender–swapped, and straight
and gender–swapped. This paper investigates the demographic and
practical implications of the phenomenon.

Our paper is organized as follows. First, we review previous
studies on the issues of gender, including gender swapping, in
MMORPGs. It has been found that male and female players have
differing goals and motivations for playing online games, with male
players being more achievement-oriented and female players being
more social relationship-oriented [8]. Despite such primary differ-
ences in motivation, the picture becomes much more textured and
interesting when males play as female avatars and females play as
male avatars. While one’s sexual orientation is shown to be moder-
ately correlated with gender swapping it is still common across all
orientations, with the majority of gamers having experienced it at
some point. A more practical motivation for gender swapping can
also be interesting: the player swaps genders in the hopes of getting
the social treatment that they think the opposite gender enjoys [36].
Second, we study the patterns of user interaction behaviors in
conjunction with the ofﬂine demographics and the online gender
conﬁgurations. We ﬁrst show that except for a rather prominent
player base of male adolescents, Fairyland Online is enjoyed by
males and females belonging to a wide age bracket. We also ﬁnd
that gender swapping is widespread, with over 40% of players own-
ing at least one avatar of the opposite gender. An interesting ques-
tion to ask is, then, whether the players’ behavior or interaction
patterns vary under different gender conﬁgurations. We pursue an-
swers to this question in two directions, ﬁrst by exploring their cor-
relation with individual play styles, then by examining how they
affect the dynamics of player-player interaction. We report the
variations and differences in the speed of level-ups, and patterns in
private conversation, friendship formation, and the trade of items
according to the gender conﬁgurations.
2. RELATED WORK
Early MMORPGs were played mostly by males [16,35]. Only later
did the female player base gradually broaden as online games saw
wider acceptance [15]. This led to research on gender-related is-
sues in games, the major works of which we review here. There
appear to be two broad lines of research: The ﬁrst is on the gen-
der differences, highlighting the variations in gaming motivations
and behaviors of the male and the female gamers. The second is
on the phenomenon of gender swapping, focusing on how and why
players choose avatars of the opposite gender to their own.
• Work on the Gender Differences in Gaming
Yee [36], based on a survey to understand the motivation for play-
ing MMORPGs, reported that female players like to play games
to form relationships, i.e. meet new people and socialize. Males,
on the other hand, were found to value achievement and successes
in missions and stronger avatars. According to Bartle [8], players
can typically be categorized into distinct types, and male players
often chose the role of achievers, and female players chose to be
socializers. Various other studies found similar gender differences
in motivation, playing style, and player type. Lo et al. showed that
male players play longer sessions and achieve higher levels [21].
Cole et al. found that males are motivated by elements of curios-
ity, surprise, and discovery, while most females played games for
their therapeutic function [13]. Most recently, Szell and Thurner
showed how females and males differ both individually and social
network-wise [28].
• Issues of Gender Swapping
Players exist as avatars inside the game, and all activities are car-
ried out as avatars. Players can freely choose their avatar’s gen-

Figure 1: A partial snapshot of the Chat network in Fairyland
Online. Two genders—one for the in-game avatar and another
for the player—are indicated: Blue (yellow) indicates a male
(female) avatar, whereas the square (circle) indicates a male (fe-
male) player.

are characterized based on graph-theoretical quantities such as their
degree and the number of interactions they participate in.

While such Social Network Analysis (SNA) has a rich history in
sociology and has recently found much success in various subﬁelds
of science and engineering [6,22,32], it often leaves out another es-
sential feature of the nodes (humans): the individual characteristics
of the subjects separate from network data per se. The demograph-
ics of the players including gender, age, and geographical location
are a good example, from which one could examine the potential
relationship between the players’ social identity or status and their
interaction patterns [24]. With the additional independent infor-
mation, we can expect the user behavior analysis to be enriched
with novel, intriguing ﬁndings should the social behavior patterns
be correlated with the node characteristics [25].

Of the many possible player identity parameters, in this paper
we focus on the players’ genders and their impact on social in-
teraction behaviors found in Fairyland Online, a globally serviced
MMORPG. Gender and its role in life are undoubtedly one of the
most celebrated issues in history, sociology, and biological sci-
ences, as it is widely accepted that gender is one of the most
salient features that people use to categorize and process social
stimuli [7, 19, 20, 33]. A virtual environment like MMORPG, tan-
talizingly, adds an intriguing twist to this phenomenon: Players are
free to choose in-game avatars of either gender, so that “gender
swapping” occurs when a player chooses to play as an avatar of the
opposite gender. Therefore we investigate the behavioral implica-
tions of the four distinct player-avatar combinations: two “straight”
(male player–male avatar, female player–female avatar) and two
“gender swapped” (male player–female avatar, female player–male
avatar).

Figure 1 serves as the motivation for our present work. It is a
local snapshot of the Chat network in Fairyland Online. There,
each node represents an avatar, while its color and shape indicate
the avatar’s gender (blue: male, yellow: female) and the player’s
gender (square: male, circle: female) who controls it. As play-
ers are free to choose their avatar’s gender, gender swapping may
give rise to interesting interaction patterns and advantages in so-
cial treatments across different types of friendship links: straight

828der, appearance, and occupation. Gender swapping occurs when
a male (female) player choose to play as a female (male) avatar.
The phenomenon was ﬁrst reported in Multi-User Dungeon (MUD)
games [10], where researchers found widespread gender swapping.
Grifﬁth et al. [16] questioned Everquest (a well-known MMORPG)
players, which shows that two third of the players had experienced
gender swapping. Hussain and Grifﬁths showed a few years later
that a majority of male and female online gamers have chosen at
least one avatar of the opposite gender [37]. Huh and Williams’s
survey shows that homosexual players are likelier to gender swap
than straight players, as they identify more readily with avatars
of the opposite gender [17], suggesting that people consider their
avatars as an expression of their identity.

Researchers have also questioned why people engage in gender
swapping. According to [37], male users engage in gender swap-
ping because they want to enjoy females’ advantages in society;
they expect that a female avatar to be treated more courteously by
male avatars. Wang also showed that male players tend to show
more prosocial behavior towards females [29]. Females, on the
other hand, showed more pronounced behavioral changes when
they swapped genders, by showing acting in a more masculine man-
ner than the average male player [17]: while socializing as female
avatars, females were shown to focus heavily on achievements in
related activities (combat, hunting, etc.) as male avatars [8].

While these previous studies brought to light valuable insights
into understanding gender differences and gender-swapping behav-
iors in online games, many of these show the potential limitations
of survey-based research, namely sampling biases and the danger
of self-selection biases [17, 36]. Conducting surveys over a small
number of people can identify a misleading tendency of the pop-
ulation. Even when surveys are conducted over thousands of sub-
jects [17, 36], there is the danger of the self-selection bias of the
samples. Also, these studies have been unable to correlate various
demographics with gender swapping, which may tell us more about
the patterns and the underlying reasons for such behavior.

3. FAIRYLAND ONLINE
In this section, we describe key features of Fairyland Online and
introduce the data set analyzed.
3.1 The Game Features
Fairyland Online (http://fairyland.lagernet.com/) is
one of the longest-serviced MMORPGs in the world. The game’s
storyline revolves around several well-known fairy tales, and play-
ers engage in turn-based combats and random encounters. Devel-
oped by Lager Network Technologies, Inc. based in Taiwan, it was
ofﬁcially launched in February 2003 in the Taiwanese market. At-
tracting more than 200,000 subscribers in less than two months fol-
lowing the launch, the game expanded to Hong Kong, China, Thai-
land, and South Korea [3]. Figure 2 is a typical snapshot of the
game, showing various gauges and avatars.

Similar to most other MMORPGs [14], the game is hosted on
multiple servers that each serves a separate realm or a world. Play-
ers join one of the realms and “live” there. Players play as avatars
of their choice, chosen from three different races (human, elf, and
dwarf), two genders (male and female), and several appearance pro-
ﬁles (outﬁt, hair style, etc.). Although one user account can possess
multiple different avatars, at a given time a user can play with only
one avatar.

Race and gender are two prominent avatar features. Race affects
the strengths and weaknesses of the avatar: For instance, human
is the most versatile race with no apparent strength or weakness.

Figure 2: An in-game snapshot of Fairyland Online that sports
a cartoonish world inspired by popular fairy tales.

Elf, on the other hand, is outstanding at magic, but tires easily
and cannot sustain their magical abilities for long. Dwarves are
earthly and dwell in seclusion but possess much physical strength,
which makes them suitable to be developed into warriors. Gen-
der, on the other hand, has no effect on the strength or weakness
of an avatar, and is merely cosmetic. Figure 3 shows some exam-
ples of the avatars in Fairyland Online. As shown in the ﬁgure, all
three races have human-looking avatars where gender of an avatar
is clearly distinguishable from its appearance.

Figure 3: Examples of avatars in Fairyland Online. There are
three races (human, elf, and dwarf) and two genders (female
and male).

The main attraction of an MMORPG is that players can interact
with each other in a variety of ways, much like in real life. Fairy-
land Online provides a set of communication channels between
players: Talk, Whisper, Family, Party, and Radio. Through a talk
channel, players can broadcast their messages to everyone in their
proximity in the game. Whisper is a private communication chan-
nel between any two players. Players can also set up a clan group or
a party group and use the family or party channel to talk in groups.
Clan represents a friendship social tie between users, while a party
represents more goal-driven, short-term social ties (e.g., exploring
dungeons or undertaking missions). Lastly, a Radio channel is an
invitation-based chat room, where players can invite others to their
radio for a chat.

Besides the communication channels, users can also trade or ex-
change items. Communication often precedes trading, indicating

829that people barter or bargain. Players can trade items, or sell and
buy items to and from the game system itself with gold.
3.2 Data
Lager Network Technologies, Inc. gracefully provided us with the
data from Fairyland Online. The data contain the complete log of
player proﬁles and player actions between March and December of
2003. Chat contents were not provided, and the actual identities of
users were anonymized for privacy concerns.

For this study, we limited ourselves to the users residing in Tai-
wan for demographic consistency. The data describes the following
information on 4,512 players and 17,610 avatars:

• The player log contains ofﬂine demographic data (age, gen-
der, and zip code) as well as other game-related information
(the realm, and the list of avatars).

• The avatar log contains the details of communication and
trade activities. It also lists in-game friends and avatar levels.

4. DEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS OF

GENDER SWAPPING

Our analyses are motivated by the following questions: Which real-
life factors lead a user to swap genders? Do real-life genders mat-
ter? Does one’s age impact a player’s choice of an avatar gender?
To answer these questions, we ﬁrst present the demographic char-
acteristics of the players and show the correlation between certain
demographic features and gender-swapping probability.
4.1 Demographic Characteristics of Players

Sociological Variables

4.1.1
The player proﬁles from Fairyland Online provide insight into sev-
eral interesting socioeconomic characteristics of the game demo-
graphic. We were able to identify the following three types of in-
formation: gender, age, and geographical location.

First, in terms of gender, there exists a fair mix of male and
female players in the game. Out of 4,512 players in the dataset,
1,819 (40.3%) were female. This is relatively higher than other
MMORPGs, where fewer are female (16–32%) [5, 17]. We be-
lieve this is due to the fact that Fairyland Online features a female-
friendly cartoon-style game world based on fairy tales.

Second, in terms of age, a vast majority (86.5%) of players are
aged between 10 and 30, with 5.4% under 10 and 7.9% over 30.
A similar observation has been made in other MMORPGs, where
adolescents and young adults are the main customers [15]. Figure 4
shows the age distribution according to gender. The male popula-
tion shows a heavy concentration around age 9–13, covering the
2nd to 6th grades in Taiwan. Except for this range, we see no ap-
parent gender difference (p>0.1). The average player age is 18.7,
and the median is 17.

Third, in terms of geographical location, we ﬁnd that players are
more or less evenly spread across the urban and the rural areas in
Taiwan. Based on the zip codes in player proﬁles, we mapped the
users’ locations onto 21 municipalities, including Taiwan’s ﬁve ma-
jor cities (Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, Taichung, and Kaohsiung).
Figure 5 shows the distribution of players across Taiwan. Regions
are divided into rural or urban areas, where each region has a pie
chart showing the male-female ratio in that region. The radius of
each pie chart reﬂects the number of players of the corresponding
region.

We see that while many players are from urban areas, quite a
large fraction of players living in the rural areas, shaded in green

show the ratio of gender in the key areas. Except for Taipei City,
the gender ratio is nearly constant across all regions (for Taipei,
p>0.1, for all regions, p<0.01). We see a slightly higher fraction of
male players in Taipei City than in other places.

4.1.2 Gamer Proﬁles
As mentioned earlier, a player can own multiple avatars, each with
its own level and friend list. In order to measure the overall charac-
teristics of the in-game player proﬁles, we examined the following
features:
the active hours of the day and the number of avatars
owned. We also examined other variables such as the game level
and trading actions, which we describe in the next section.

The ﬁrst measure indicates at which hours of the day a user typ-
ically plays the game. To infer this, we deﬁned a session, as the
game log does not indicate when a user is actually playing. This
happens to be a common issue in many web logs including Internet
browsing and Internet TV watching [11], since users simply leave
their computers on and resume online activities after a prolonged
period of time. For our purposes, we deﬁned a session as a time

window containing consecutive actions of an avatar separated by
no more than ten minutes.1

For each hour of a day, we could then identify how many avatars
and players were active. Figure 6 displays the number of active
players from a random day within the trace period. The plot is
divided to show the pattern of the gender and the age of active
players. The number is the smallest around 5AM, while it is the
largest around 8–9PM. There was no particular gender-speciﬁc pat-
tern (p>0.1). Age-wise, we see an increase (from 21.0% to 31.8%)
in the activity of players aged 4 to 16 between June and August,
which corresponds to the summer vacation in Taiwan.

The second measure, the number of avatars owned, also indicates
the activity of gamers. Figure 7 shows the number of avatars per
player. The distribution is skewed, meaning that the majority of
players own a small number of avatars, whereas some players own
more than 10 avatars. In fact, 74.7% of players owned no more than
4 avatars. We ﬁnd that gender does not play a role in determining
the number of avatars owned (p>0.1).

4.2 Prevalence of Gender-Swapping
Players are free to choose the gender of their avatars, resulting in
the phenomenon of gender swapping [10]. Here, we present the
prevalence of gender swapping in Fairyland Online and its correla-
tion with certain demographical features.

First we see that over a third of players owned at least one
gender-swapped avatar. Table 1 shows that female players are more
likely to own gender-swapped avatars than male players (p<0.001).
This is consistent with past research that a sizable fraction of play-
ers swap genders, and females tend to do so more than males [37].

1The data reveals that nearly all (98.4%) of consecutive actions are

total) with gender-swapped avatar(s) in the urban and the rural
areas of Taiwan.

The geographical location, living in urban or rural regions, was
found not to be correlated with gender swapping (p>0.1).

We then analyzed gender swapping tendencies and the number of
avatars owned. Figure 8 shows the prevalence of gender-swapping
as a function of the player age and the number of avatars owned. It
shows the gender-swapping ratio, deﬁned as the number of gender-
swapped avatars divided by the total number of avatars owned. The
upper plot in Figure 8 shows that older players are more likely to
swap genders than younger players. The bottom plot in Figure 8
shows that the number of avatars has a positive correlation with
the ratio of gender swapping. The prevalence of gender swapping
among the older and more experienced players suggests that there
may be intriguing behavioral motivations and patterns, which we
discuss in the subsequent section.
4.3 Summary
In this section we examined the demographic features of players to
understand which ofﬂine and online traits correlated with gender
swapping. We found that gender-swapping ratios were indepen-
dent of where people live and when they played the game. The
ratios, however, showed a strong correlation with players’ age and
how active they were. The fact that older players swapped genders
more often means that gender swapping may reﬂect some mature
psychological aspects. That the gender-swapping ratio was higher
for players with more avatars may indicate that experienced players
know the beneﬁts of gender swapping.

5. EFFECT OF GENDER SWAPPING

ON IN-GAME BEHAVIOR

To understand how gender swapping impacts a player’s behavior,
we study four major activities of Fairyland Online: avatar level-
ups, private communication, friendship formation and preservation,
and trade. Among these, avatars’ game levels represent personal
achievements and progress, while the latter three represent social
actions. For each of these, we verify the extent to which behav-
iors of gender swappers deviate from those of non-swappers. We
introduce the following notation for the four player-gender combi-
nations, the “gender tuple”:

For instance, M.M and M.F indicate a male playing as a male and
a female avatar, respectively.
5.1 Levels: Individual Achievements
Avatar levels represent the measure of personal development and
progress in a game that is often the primary objective of gamers
in an MMORPG [13, 36]. A higher level is obtained when players
complete missions successfully and collect enough points. Primar-
ily the avatar level indicates the player’s skill and the time they have
put into the game. We asked, does gender swapping give the player
any advantage in attaining higher levels?

To see the impact of gender swapping on game levels, we stud-
ied game players who have played with avatars of both genders,
ignoring all other players who own avatars that are of one gen-
der. This left us with 1,386 players. Among those, we extracted
the highest levels of their male and female avatars (as they may
own multiple avatars with the same gender). We then calculated
the level difference between one’s highest-level male and female
avatars, plotted in Figure 9. For females (upper panel), their
strongest female avatars’ level tends to be slightly higher than that
of their strongest male avatars’ level and vice versa (lower panel),
indicating that more players achieved the highest levels with their
“straight” avatars. The peaks are close to zero, indicating that for
many players the difference is rather minute.

While this may seem to indicate that gender swapping corre-
lates negatively with avatar levels and in practice is not particularly
advantageous, Figure 9 is likely biased as players spend varying
amounts of time with different avatars, which is the strongest in-
dicator of one’s level. We ﬁnd, in fact, that in Fairyland Online
players are prone to playing longer with avatars of the same gen-
der as their own. To quantify the effect, we examined the rate at
which users leveled up with and without gender swapping. Fig-
ure 10 shows the relationship between the ﬁnal avatar level and the
total time played in Fairyland Online for the four different gen-

der tuples for the 1,386 players. Here the x-axis is the ﬁnal avatar
level, and the y-axis is the total amount of time played by the avatar
(starting at level 1).

From Figure 10 we can make the following three observations.
Firstly, leveling up takes an increasing amount of time as one’s
level rises (seen from the shape of the curve). This is a common
feature of many games that incorporate the level system. Secondly,
male players level up more quickly than female players. To ver-
ify this, we computed the total time played until one reaches a
given level, and inferred the average time spent at each level. We
then tested if there was any meaningful difference in the average
time spent between the male and female players at each level us-
ing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. We found sufﬁcient ev-
idence to support that the two average time distributions are dif-
ferent (D=0.0611 and p<0.01). This is also in line with previous
study that male players are more efﬁcient “achievers” in the vir-
tual world than female players [36]. Thirdly, both male and female
players achieve a given level more quickly via a male avatar than
via a female avatar. This ﬁnding is especially intriguing for female
players, because this suggets a concrete beneﬁt of gender swapping.
For instance, F.F players (i.e., female players logged on with fe-
male avatars) played on average 19.24 hours more to reach level
50 than F.M players. We again used the K-S test and conﬁrmed
meaningful difference between F.F and F.M players (D=0.1824
and p<0.001). Since the gender of an avatar is a cosmetic factor
with no difference in abilities in Fairyland Online, this means that
female players exhibit a rather drastic transformation into male-like
aggressive, achievement-oriented characteristic when pretending as
a male avatar [8].
5.2 Whisper: Private One-to-One Messaging
Here and in the two subsequent sections we study user-to-user in-
teractions. The ﬁrst one is “Whisper”, a private one-to-one com-
munication function. While players can whisper to any user in the

game, the messages are revealed to the sender and the receiver only,
as opposed to public broadcast. Whispering thus can reveal the pat-
terns of afﬁnity between users.

In order to determine the effect of gender in whispering, we ex-
amined the probability that a given user of type A.B sends whispers
to another user of type A(cid:2).B(cid:2)
from the entire data. Since whisper
interaction is directional, there are 16 possible gender combinations
(A.B → A(cid:2).B(cid:2)
). For comparison, we also computed its null val-
ues, the expected probability of whisper when we assume that the
sender of a whisper selects its receiver at random regardless of their
gender combination, by randomly matching 10,000 pairs of avatars
in the network.

Table 2 displays the magniﬁcation factor of the probability of
whisper (i.e., the real probability divided by its random expecta-
tion). Therefore a value larger than 1.0 (marked in bold) indicates
that the whispers occurred more frequently than expected. The ta-
ble shows a trend where a whisper is likelier to take place between
avatars of different genders, whichever the players’ genders are.
For instance, a male player with a male avatar (M.M) is1 .26 to
1.34 times likelier to send a whisper message to a female avatar
(both M.F and F.F ) than expected by chance.
In contrast, the
probability dropped roughly by a third to a half when the other
player had a male avatar (M.M or F.M), irrespective of the true
gender of the other player.

Despite this interesting trend we may need to take caution, as
whisper does not necessarily imply a substantial relationship; since
one can send a whisper to any random player, some whispers may
only be a failed, unreciprocated attempt to strike up a real, sub-
stantive conversation. Hence to ﬁnd patterns of a sustained, con-
crete conversation that took place for some measurable time, we
chose and focused on all avatar pairs that exchanged no less than 35
whispers in total, of which there were 36,820 avatar pairs. As they
were reciprocated whisper pairs, we ignored the sender-receiver re-
lationship, and examined how the gender conﬁgurations affected
the length of the conversation, presuming that a longer conversa-
tion meant a more substantial relationship.

We compared the duration of conversations between three types
of player pairs: female and female, female and male, and male and
male. When we considered all conversations (involving at least
one whisper message), we found that the median and the mean du-
rations were 3.1 minutes and 33.7 minutes, respectively. The large
discrepancy between the two indicates a possible right-skewed dis-
tribution of conversations (e.g., certain conversations lasting sev-
eral hours or more). Looking at the 36,820 pairs (with 35 whispers

or more), we found that the median and the mean duration were
32.6 minutes and 125.9 minutes, respectively.

In Figure 11 we show the relative duration of the long conversa-
tions for the different types of player gender pairs. We normalized
the duration so that the highest bar is 100. For each player pair type,
we show two bars: one where the avatar genders are the same and
another where avatar genders are opposite. The ﬁgure shows that
players engage in a lengthier conversation when their avatars are of
different genders regardless of the true genders of the players. In
fact, the conversation duration increased 1.62- to 1.77-fold when
the avatars were of the opposite sex. Controlling for avatar gen-
ders, we also ﬁnd that conversation involving a female player lasts
longer. This supports a well-established notion that females tend to
socialize more actively than male players do in online games [17].
5.3 Friendship: Sustained social ties
The next interaction we analyze is friendship. In Fairyland Online,
each avatar maintains a “friend list” of other avatars. Unlike whis-
per, a friendship tie is bidirectional in that both avatars must agree
to be friends. Once friends, users can easily locate and contact each
other inside the virtual world. We examine whether gender swap-
ping affects the chance of people becoming friends.

To compute the effect of avatar gender on the chance of form-
ing a friendship tie between different avatars, we ﬁrst note that
there are 10 possible gender conﬁgurations in a bidirectional link
(player1.avatar1 and player2.avatar2). Then we count all friend-
ship links between gender types, and compare it with the randomly
expected number of friendship links without considering genders.
The resulting magniﬁcation factor (i.e., observed frequencies di-
vided by random expectation) are shown in Table 3. The table is
symmetric, as friendship is bidirectional. The larger-than-expected
pair types (the values larger than 1.0) are marked in bold.

Table 3: The prevalence of friendship divided by random ex-
pectations across all possible gender tuples.

The table shows a higher probability of friendship formation be-
tween the same-gendered players, so that a male player is likelier to
befriend another male player than a female player, and vice versa.
Interestingly, controlling for player genders, we found that the play-
ers were slightly likelier to form a friendship tie when their avatars
had opposite genders. For instance, two female players were 1.26
times more likely to become friends with each other when their
avatars differed than when they did not. Since players are not told
of the real gender of other players and can only see the avatar gen-
der, this appears to indicate the possibility that a subconscious, im-
plicit selection process may be at work [26]. The pattern of people
being linked more often when they are of the same gender but of
different avatar genders was observed also in the whisper network.
5.4 Trade: Exchange and Sales of Items
Lastly, we study the patterns of Trade, namely the exchange and
sales of items. The economic activity of item acquisition and cur-
rency transfer is a staple of MMORPGs, as players need various
items to strengthen, heal, or embellish their avatars. Since items
are often directly related to one’s performance, trade is a highly
strategic activity and can incur other activities as its precursor or af-
termath: private conversations often precede trading and social ties
can be formed afterwards [26]. Highly valuable items can fetch
such a high price that some players become serious businessmen
dedicated to item acquisition and sales, often making a handsome
sum of real money by selling them online or ofﬂine [31].

We investigate whether a player’s or an avatar’s gender has any
impact on trade. Fairyland Online provides a wide variety of items
for use and trade. Furthermore, some items are indispensable in
that players need those items to qualify for a level-up (a Fairyland
Online-speciﬁc example would be a bunny required at a certain
level that can be lured with a particular herb). All these needs are
motivations for trade, which can take a form of item-to-item barter-
ing or straight-up sale for gold.

Our data contain all trading interactions, allowing us to observe
details of the trade activities including the item traded and its price.

To see the relation with gender, we ﬁrst extracted the most traded
items during the ten-month observational period and built a list of
its market value (price), the median gold fetched in sales. We inten-
tionally omitted bartering (item-for-item) because the market value
of an item was difﬁcult to determine from such data. Table 4 shows
the ﬁve most traded items along with their median market prices.

We then examined the frequency of trade and the price of each
item between different gender combinations. For simplicity, we ex-
amined the average selling and buying prices that the items fetched
from trades between the four gender combinations (M.M, M.F ,
F.M, and F.F ). The difference between the two, i.e., the average
selling price minus the average buying price, would be the expected
monetary gain for the selling player. The net gains calculated in this
fashion are also shown in Table 4.

We ﬁnd a few interesting patterns regarding trade in Table 4.
First, the selling and the buying prices can vary widely depending
on the player’s gender as well as that of the avatar: for instance,
Healing Potion is sold at a higher price when the seller is a F.F
than when they are F.M, even though the real player gender is the
same. Second, focusing only on signiﬁcant net gains (deﬁned to
be exhibiting more than a 5% gain over the median market price),
we ﬁnd that female players in general make better, more proﬁtable
salespeople than males do. When we control for the player gender,
we also saw that female avatars were likelier to succeed in proﬁting
from trade than male avatars. This could imply that male players
beneﬁt through gender swapping in trades.

We also tracked select items, which revealed to us some interest-
ing potential mechanisms of price determination. The Healing Po-
tion, for instance, is a popular item among players who were war-
riors or enjoyed combats, i.e., usually male avatars. Hence, such
“achievers” may be willing to buy them above market price if they
need to. Then their willingness could be exploited by those who do
not need the item, for instance female avatars who are more of the
“socializer.” This could be a plausible explanation for the sizable
discrepancies in the expected net gain of Healing Potion between
F.F and F.M, as we saw also in other contexts that female players
become drastically aggressive and masculine when controlling a
male avatar. A similar dynamic might apply to other items as well,
although many other factors may well be at play that need further
examination.
5.5 Summary
In this section, we investigated how peoples’ behaviors change
when they swap genders of the avatars they control. Our major
ﬁndings include that male players achieve higher levels faster than
females in general, but female players also do so when they play
with male avatars; and players tend to whisper more to opposite
gender avatars, but they are likelier to become friends with play-
ers of the same gender. Our study also showed that female avatars
in many cases proﬁted from trade than male avatars did. The fact
that many items were sold at different prices for the male and fe-
male avatars at statistically signiﬁcant levels may imply an intricate
relationship between the traded items and avatar genders.

Since there are no built-in capability differences in male and
female avatars,
the fact that we observe signiﬁcant behavioral
changes implies that people act according to the perception or the
image of the gender that they are playing and of the gender of the
interacting players. Therefore there may also be advantages in gen-
der swapping, not innate but derived from people’s subjective per-
ception and the resulting responses, leading to the intriguing differ-
ences in the behavior patterns [17].

IMPLICATIONS

6.
In this paper, we have examined the gender swapping behavior in
MMORPG. Through several key interaction patterns, we found that
male players act and get treated more like a female when playing
with a female avatar (e.g., chatted for a longer period of time, en-
joyed increased afﬁnity by other M.M players, traded items at a
higher price), and vice versa for female players. Our major ﬁndings
on how gender roles and identity are associated with avatars (rather
than players) suggest several interesting applications, of which two
major ones are:

• Bot detection. As the business model of MMORPGs is
subscription-based and requires the players to commit sub-
stantial amounts of time, the level of realism expected by the
users is very high. The proliferation of ‘bots,’ automatons
controlled by computer AI, is widely accepted as the most
serious threat to an MMORPG’s success. Bots lack the abil-
ity to interact with other players in any interesting manner
all the while helping their masters (deployers) with an unde-
served advantage by performing repetitive, menial tasks such
as resource harvesting without break. Thus bots damage the
realism of the game and the game balance required to main-
tain human players’ interests, and detecting them is an urgent
matter. Bot detection often works by “weeding out” in-game
avatars that lack the complexity and nuance shown by true
humans. The richness of intriguing human behavior that we
witnessed when we factored in gender suggests that gender
could also be a useful parameter in detecting bots [23].

• Online identity fraud detection. Our ﬁndings here could also
be potentially useful in detecting online identity fraud [12],
which can sometimes result in a serious damage, either ﬁ-
nancially or physically [2]. As one’s true identity is easily
hidden online—in this context, the gender and age would be
the most prone to be lied about—from a conversation partner
and needs to be deduced from personal behavioral patterns
only, the user behaviors of gender-swapped players as re-
ported here could assist in building proﬁles of potential crim-
inals.

Similar to detecting bots and fraud, detection of malicious users
and other types of potential criminals (sybils and cheaters) is often
conducted by analyzing user behaviors in many web services [9,
30, 34]. Our study can produce valuable insights in this regard.

7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the issue of gender in large-scale
MMORPG social interaction networks, and investigated an inter-
esting problem in human behavioral research called gender swap-

ping. While there have been some past studies on the issue, they
were based on uncontrolled online opinion surveys, which could
have been subject to self-selection bias. Unlike the previous works,
we used the complete interaction and proﬁle data of the players
from Fairyland Online, thereby easily overcoming the limitations
of self-selection bias and small scale. We searched for intrigu-
ing patterns of social behavior that were potentially correlated with
gender swapping, and found several signiﬁcant trends in conversa-
tion, friendship formation, and economic behavior.

Our biggest ﬁnding was that (a) gender swapping is prevalent
across player gender and age, and it becomes more prevalent with
the players’ age, experience, and activity; (b) while in an online
setting people try to make friends with the opposite sex, they turn
out to be of the same gender in real life, indicating that assuming
an alternative identity does not completely mask the real persona;
(c) female players tend to act more masculine and achievement-
oriented when acting as a male than actual males do; and (d) peo-
ple’s personalities and strategies (such as when trading for items
or gold) depend on their assumed identities, an example being that
female avatars, regardless of the player’s real gender, appear more
successful at trade.

With these interesting ﬁndings, we believe we have demonstrated
the potential of massive user data sets from MMORPGs in studying
intriguing and important human psychology and behavior. Free of
self-selection bias and limitations of scale, we were able to make
two novel observations that had not been shown in previous studies:
one is that both male and female players tend to talk more with
avatars of the opposite gender; two players tend to become friends
with others whose real gender is the same as one’s own even though
they only know the virtual gender of others.

We foresee multiple interesting avenues for taking our research
further, as our ability to observe human behavior and analyze them
ever improve both online and ofﬂine. Here we propose two possi-
ble examples. First, a natural extension of our work would be to
consider more types of user interactions including many-to-many
interactions, i.e., group dynamics, which can be signiﬁcantly more
complex than one-to-one interactions that we studied here. Since
a main attraction of MMORPGs can in fact be found in group ac-
tivities, exploring how gender affects such interactions would be a
necessary next step. Second, if we could deﬁne and retrieve even
more details of the interactions–the content of a conversation, for
instance–there would be an exponential development in how we an-
alyze and understand the full complexity of human social behavior.
One example usage of the conversation data would be a study of
the role of verbal cues and gender identities, as it is believed that
verbal cues can be instrumental in revealing a person’s identity, and
we would ﬁnd many applications of the lessons learned from how
gender swappers change their language patterns.
