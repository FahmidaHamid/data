ABSTRACT
The complex and dynamic nature of search processes sur-
rounding information seeking have been exhaustively stud-
ied. Recent studies have highlighted search processes with
diﬀerent intentions, such as those for entertainment pur-
poses or re-ﬁnding a visited information object, are funda-
mentally diﬀerent in nature to typical information seeking
intentions. Despite the popularity of such search processes
on the Web, they have not yet been thoroughly explored.
Using a video retrieval system as a use case, we study the
characteristics of four diﬀerent search task types: seeking
information, re-ﬁnding a particular information object, and
two diﬀerent entertainment intentions (i.e. entertainment
by adjusting arousal level, and entertainment by adjusting
mood). In particular, we looked at the cognition, emotion
and action aspects of these search tasks at diﬀerent phases
of a search process. This follows the common assumption
in the information seeking and retrieval community that a
complex search process can be broken down into a relatively
small number of activity phases. Our experimental results
show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the characteristics of studied
search tasks. Furthermore, we investigate whether we can
predict these search tasks given user’s interaction with the
system. Results show that we can learn a model that pre-
dicts the search task types with reasonable accuracy. Over-
all, these ﬁndings may help to steer search engines to better
satisfy searchers’ needs beyond typically assumed informa-
tion seeking processes.

searchers’ intentions1 do not always ﬁt into the typical tax-
onomy of informational, navigational or transactional inten-
tions [37]. Although informational (i.e. to acquire informa-
tion present on one or more sites), navigational (i.e. to reach
a particular site) and transactional (i.e.
to perform some
Web-mediated activity) intentions are all commonly found
in query logs [9], there is an increasing body of evidence
showing that re-ﬁnding and re-retrieving visited information
is a regular activity for searchers [37, 12]. In addition, there
is also recent interest in the notion of entertainment, where
the searchers do not have any particular information need
[13] and the prime motivation behind their search is to sat-
isfy an emotion need [28]. The aim of this paper is to study
the characteristics of search processes motivated by diﬀerent
intentions, i.e.
information seeking, re-ﬁnding information
and/or entertainment.

Knowledge of the underlying intentions of searchers en-
gaging in a search process on the Web can be very beneﬁ-
cial to better satisfy their needs. Web search engines con-
stantly improve their retrieval eﬀectiveness by mining in-
formation from query logs with regards to diﬀerent aspects
of the search processes, including prediction of the search
(query) intents. The aim of this paper is to study and com-
pare the seeking activities occurring during search processes
with diﬀerent intents. Through this, we can better quantify
searchers’ needs, and in turn improve the eﬀectiveness of the
recommendation, query suggestion, retrieval, presentation,
etc.

As has traditionally been explored, the information seek-
ing process is complex and dynamic [19, 6]. It is complex
because it involves a searcher with an information need (IN )
initiated by an anomaly in his or her current state of knowl-
edge [7], who is seeking information to resolve the problem,
and in turn satisfy the need. This need is usually trans-
formed into a query and submitted to a retrieval system
where a set of potentially relevant documents are retrieved
and presented. However, the formulated query does not al-
ways provide an adequate description necessary to retrieve
relevant documents [40] since it is only an approximation
of the actual information need [36]. Likewise, it may not
adequately deﬁne the characteristics of relevant documents,
or indeed any relevant information, because of an ill-deﬁned
information need situation. Therefore, in the majority of
cases, searchers are unsatisﬁed with the results obtained in
response to their initial retrieval formulation [38], and must
engage in further interaction with the system to resolve their

931needs. This introduces the dynamic aspect of the informa-
tion seeking process which we will further examine.

The dynamic aspect of the information seeking process
refers to the development and evolution of IN during a search
session [35], from an initially vague state to a clear and well-
deﬁned one [20]. This change in IN can happen dramatically
or gradually [30] as a result of new information a searcher
is exposed to, i.e. the perusal of relevant, and even irrel-
evant documents [40]. This evolution of IN improves the
searcher’s query statement formulation[4], and changes what
they consider relevant at both the early and late stages of
the search [31]. However, two important questions emerge.
First, whether such characteristics are generalizable to other
search scenarios where the motivation is other than seek-
ing information, e.g. re-ﬁnding or entertainment. Second,
whether these search scenarios can be modelled via such
characteristics.

In order to investigate our research questions, we follow
a common approach for modelling and explaining informa-
tion seeking behaviour.
In general, it assumes that com-
plex information seeking and retrieval process can be bro-
ken down into a relatively small number of activity stages
(which we refer to as phases) [16] (p. 138) within which
user behaviour is investigated. Kuhlthau’s information seek-
ing process (ISP) model investigated the aﬀect, cognition
and action of participants in diﬀerent phases of an informa-
tion seeking process [22]. Although Kuhlthau’s ISP model
was originally proposed for long term information seeking
processes, she explains that the concepts of process, uncer-
tainty and complexity emerging from her ISP model can
be useful for designing user-centred IR systems [23].
In-
deed many researchers follow this approach in information
retrieval scenarios, e.g. White et al.
[40]. Using an inter-
active IR framework, we investigate the characteristics of
information seeking, re-ﬁnding,
four search processes i.e.
and two diﬀerent entertainment intentions.
In particular,
we divide each search process into a small number of phases
where the searchers’ interactions within each phase is stud-
ied. Finally, we investigate the predictability of the search
motivation given the interaction history at diﬀerent phases
of the search process.

This paper has three novel contributions. First, based on
sociology literature, two simulated search tasks are designed
for entertainment-based search processes. Second, the char-
acteristics of search tasks with diﬀerent intentions are stud-
ied using data gathered via questionnaires and interaction
history. Finally, the predictability of the search intents is
investigated given the interaction history at diﬀerent points
of a search process. The remainder of the paper is organ-
ised as follows: related works are presented in Section 2, the
experiment methodology is described in Section 3. Results
and discussion are presented in Section 4, and ﬁnally the
paper is concluded in Section 5.

2. RELATED WORK

Seeking Information on the Web: Web search sys-
tems such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! are important tools
for seeking and accessing information on the World Wide
Web (the Web). As we discussed earlier (see Section 1),
the information seeking process is complex and dynamic
in nature. Many past theories and models have attempted
to explain the complexity and dynamic nature of informa-
tion seeking processes. In general they assume that complex

information seeking and retrieval behaviour can be broken
down into a relatively small number of activity stages [16]
(p. 138). For example, Kuhlthau’s information seeking pro-
cess (ISP) model illustrates information seeking activities
in six stages, each of which diﬀerentiated and determined
the cognitive, aﬀective and physical aspects of a searcher.
Kuhlthau’s model is one of the most popular models to in-
vestigate the cognitive, aﬀective and physical aspects of a
searcher in an information seeking process. She demon-
strated that searchers adopt diﬀerent information seeking
strategies as they move from one stage of the ISP to an-
other. Furthermore, she demonstrated that people’s feel-
ings, thoughts and actions interact within the ISP. The fun-
damental principle behind Kuhlthau’s model is the uncer-
tainty principle [22]. This refers to the existence of a cog-
nitive state which causes feelings of anxiety and lack of
conﬁdence. Feelings of doubt, anxiety and frustration are
associated with vague and unclear thoughts. The model
shows that during a typical information seeking process,
the thoughts of a searcher become clear; consequently, their
conﬁdence increases and their feeling of doubt, anxiety and
frustration decrease. Following this approach, in this paper
we investigate cognition, emotion and interaction aspects of
search tasks with diﬀerent intentions.

The cognitive aspect of the ISP has been an important
theme of IR research since the earliest work in the ﬁeld.
Belkin et al.
[7] explain that the information need moti-
vating an ISP is derived from searchers’ anomalous state
of knowledge (ASK). The ASK refers to the gap between
what searchers know and what they want to know. Taylor
[36] explained that query formulation can be a cognitively
demanding process, and the searchers’ queries are approxi-
mate representations of the actual information needs. This
query formulation problem can be magniﬁed if searchers are
facing a vague or ill-deﬁned information need [35]. On the
other hand, Saracevic [31] discussed how the concept of rele-
vance can change for searchers during an ISP as a result of a
change or development in their information needs through-
out the search. These ﬁndings motivated a great deal of past
research. However, user activity and expectations on the
Web have now expanded well beyond traditionally studied
information seeking process. This has led to an emergence
of characteristically diﬀerent search tasks, such as those of
entertainment purposes [27]. As such, it is the right time to
revisit and verify these ﬁndings. This paper is an attempt
in this vein of research.

In recent years the emotion aspect of the information seek-
ing process has gained much attention. For example, several
works studied the emotional impact of search tasks within
the ISP [29, 1, 25].
[29] examined how participants emo-
tion responses are inﬂuenced by tasks of diﬀerent nature. In
particular, their results indicate that (i) artiﬁcial tasks have
higher uncertainty and less sense of ownership than gen-
uine search tasks, and (ii) more complex search tasks have
lower positive emotions and more uncertainty before and
after searching. Similar ﬁndings were earlier reported also
by [1] in an information seeking activity. They concluded
that users’ emotions progressively transit from positive to
negative valence as the degree of task diﬃculty increases.
They also found that emotions both interweave with dif-
ferent physiological, psychological and cognitive processes
during an information seeking process, and form distinctive
patterns according to speciﬁc tasks [2]. However, [25] re-

932ported no signiﬁcant relationship between searchers’ mood
and search tasks due to the complexity involved in such stud-
ies. In another study, [18] investigated the relationship be-
tween the subjective (e.g. happiness levels, feeling lost dur-
ing search, etc.) and objective (e.g. search outcomes and
search task characteristics, etc.) factors in the ISP. Their
results show that “higher happiness levels before the search
and during the search correlate with better feelings after the
search, but also correlate with worse search outcomes and
lower satisfaction, suggesting that, perhaps, it pays oﬀ to
feel some ‘pain’ during the search in order to ‘gain’ quality
outcomes” [18]. Despite their valuable insights into various
aspects of emotion in the ISP, they do not provide insights
into how the trend of emotion varies for search sessions with
diﬀerent search intents. This paper investigates the answer
to this research question.

The interaction aspect of the ISP is by far the most stud-
ied aspect in both research and practice. One of the im-
portant research topics is to understand the intent of search
activity. Broder [9] studied Web query logs and categorised
the submitted queries into three main search intents: infor-
mational, navigational, and transactional. The important
outcome of this work was the realisation of the existence
of search intents other than the informational intent, which
was traditionally assumed to be dominant. In a more recent
study, other search intents have been identiﬁed, such as re-
ﬁnding [37] and entertainment [13]. Teevan et al.
[37], by
analysing Yahoo! Web query logs showed that up to 40%
of the submitted queries were re-ﬁnding queries. Elsweiler
et al. [12], in an empirical study, showed that it is possible
to isolate re-ﬁnding behaviour in the logs through various
qualitative and quantitative analyses. Other researchers in-
vestigated the possibility of predicting diﬀerent search in-
tents from the query log data. For example, Shen et al. [33]
proposed a novel model for user intent, leveraging search
sessions by learning intermediate hidden-dynamics between
intent class labels and user behaviour variables.
In gen-
eral, query intent prediction can be categorised into two
methods: context-aware and non-context-aware [33]. Non-
context-aware methods learn a model by relying only on the
current searchers’ behaviours, e.g current submitted query
and/or click-though data [24] whereas context-aware meth-
ods taken into account both current and past searchers’ be-
haviour throughout the search session [10]. The underlying
assumption behind the context-aware methods is that adja-
cent user behaviour is semantically related and follows the
same search intent. It has been shown that context-aware
methods outperform the non-context-aware ones [33].
In
contrast to previous work, where the main task is to opti-
mise the retrieval results with respect to the query intent,
this paper studies search behaviour with diﬀerent intents
and tries to compare their characteristics across sessions.

Seeking Entertainment on the Web: Due to the
ubiquity of the emotionally-rich content on the Web (e.g.,
news, music, movies, etc.), it is important to understand
the search behaviour which has an entertainment aspect. It
is not controversial to state that entertainment has an im-
portant role in human life. The consumable media on the
Web, which is particularly easy to access nowadays, pro-
vides people with vast varieties of content, making it the
most popular type of entertainment. It has therefore been
of particular interest to understand its uses and eﬀects on
people. Zillmann [39] was instrumental in the development

and establishment of a range of theories in this domain. His
mood management theory explains why and how the audi-
ence seeks entertainment.

The underlying speculation of the mood management the-
ory is that hedonistic motivation is a key factor in aﬀecting
the entertainment selection process [42]. Zillmann and his
colleagues posit that entertainment choices are a reﬂection
of a basic human need to enhance or retain positive states,
and to lessen or steer clear of negative ones [28]. They have
suggested two possible states in which there may be a need
for regulation: physiological arousal and aﬀect. In the case
of physiological arousal, mood management theory suggests
that users might be over-stimulated (i.e., stress) or under-
stimulated (i.e., boredom). An individual experiencing such
states will choose their entertainment content according to
their expectations of what would lead them back to an op-
timal state [28]. In the case of aﬀect states, mood manage-
ment theory suggests that users might be in negative (i.e.
dysphoric) or positive (i.e. upbeat) moods. An individ-
ual experiencing negative aﬀects will choose entertainment
content that helps them to alleviate or diminish the negative
mood, and those experiencing positive aﬀects will choose en-
tertainment content that helps them to intensify or prolong
their state [28].

Recently, there was an increased eﬀort in the research
community in developing IR systems that cope with search
processes for entertainment intents. The “Entertain Me” [5]
and “Search4FUN” workshops [14] began to explore this area
and build resources, such as test collections and evaluation
benchmarks. Besides the works published in these work-
shops, some research has been published that attempts to
use emotion in information retrieval. We review this in the
remaining part of this section. [13] attempted to understand
the needs and motivation underlying leisure-based activities
in the context of television viewing. They reported that
the nature of the need and motivation are diﬀerent between
leisure-based and work-based situations where most of the
needs reported for leisure-based situation are motivated by
a desire to change mood, emotion, or arousal level. An-
other research related to leisure-based activity is the work by
[32] which studies pleasure reading behaviour. Their results
show that pleasure readers ﬁnd information without having
any prior information need. In addition, [41] and in a more
in-depth version, [15], study the characteristics of casual-
leisure search as an example of an exploratory search sce-
nario. They reported that in casual search, the motivation is
not to resolve an information need but is rather hedonistic,
e.g. entertainment driven. Given their results, [15] deﬁne
a casual-leisure information behaviour model highlighting
the key diﬀerences between casual-leisure scenarios and typ-
ical information behaviour theory. Despite these attempts,
our understanding of entertainment-based search processes
is still in its infancy. Given the emergence of entertainment
seeking intentions on the Web and the unexplored character-
istics of them, in this paper we investigate two entertainment
seeking tasks: entertainment by adjusting arousal level and
entertainment by adjusting mood.

3. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY
3.1 Experiment Design

This study used a within subject design. The independent
variable was the search intents (with four levels: “Informa-

933tion Seeking” (INS), “Information Re-ﬁnding” (INF), “En-
tertainment by adjusting Arousal” (ENA), “Entertainment
by adjusting Mood” (ENM)), which was controlled by the
simulated search task given to the participants (see Section
3.2). We did not perform any control on the number of rele-
vant and irrelevant results in order to simulate a real search
scenario situation as much as possible. The dependent vari-
ables are the qualitative (gathered through questionnaire)
and quantitative (gathered through system interaction log-
ging) data.
3.2 Tasks

We prepared four search task scenarios, each simulating
diﬀerent search intent. The search tasks were presented us-
ing the structural framework of simulated need situations [8].
By doing so, we introduced short cover stories that helped
us describe to our participants the source of their informa-
tion need, the context of the situation and the problem to be
solved. This facilitated a better understanding of the search
objective and introduced a layer of realism, while preserving
well-deﬁned relevance criteria. In the following, each of the
search tasks is explained in detail.

3.2.1 INS Task

This search task simulates the information seeking search
scenario. Information seeking is the most studied topic in
the ﬁeld. This task is designed as a control group since
the majority of cognition and emotion ﬁndings in the past
were based on a similar search task intent. For this search
task, we prepared a number of search topics that covered a
variety of contexts in order to capture participants’ interests
as best as possible. The topics, presented in Table 1, were
all checked manually, prior to the experiment, to ensure the
availability of relevant documents. The simulated search
scenario for INS task was as follows: “Imagine you have
graduated recently and are going to interview for a job in
a local company. As part of the interview process, you are
asked to explain and expand on the area you will be working
on. You feel very enthusiastic about the interview; however,
due to your lack of knowledge you would like to ﬁnd out
more about this particular topic before taking part in the
interview.” Each participant was then asked to choose one
of the topics that they were unfamiliar with but consider
interesting. Using the video retrieval system, they had to
ﬁnd as many relevant videos as possible so that they could
construct a good knowledge about their selected topic.

Table 1: Search topics for the information seeking task scenario.

Obtaining information regarding contraception methods.
Investigating new knowledge on global warming.
Formulating an opinion about existing social networking sites.

3.2.2 INF Task

This search task simulates the information re-ﬁnding search
intent. There are two diﬀerences between this task and the
previous one: (i) there is only one document that can satisfy
the information need of the searcher, and (ii) the searcher
has seen the relevant documents at some point before ini-
tiating the search process and is now attempting to re-ﬁnd
it. The similarity between this task and the previous one is
that in both cases searchers have an information need.

For this search task, we prepared a number of videos that
covered a variety of contexts in order to capture participants’
interests as best as possible. The videos were intentionally
selected as they would likely be very hard to ﬁnd because
they lacked textual description. The motivation was to sim-
ulate a challenging information re-ﬁnding process where the
recalled terms are very ambiguous and do not lead directly
to the relevant item. This would better represent many real-
istic re-ﬁnding tasks, when the user cannot recall the exact
description of the item they are looking for. Of course this
only considers one spectrum of re-ﬁnding tasks, and more
exhaustive studies of such tasks needs to be done in the fu-
ture. The simulated search scenario for INF task was as
follows: “Imagine you are discussing a video which you have
seen few days ago with your friends. They are interested in
seeing the video and have asked you to send them a link to it.
You can remember the content of the video but you cannot
remember its title or any textual information which can help
you in retrieving it.” Each participant was then asked to
select and watch one of the three videos presented to them
(an animal2, martial arts3, or a science video4) that they
are unfamiliar with and consider interesting. Once partici-
pants watched the video, they were asked to ﬁnd it as fast
as possible.

3.2.3 ENA Task

This search task simulates the entertainment-based search
intent where searchers adjust their arousal level. The main
diﬀerence between this task and the two tasks before is that
the primary need is hedonistic rather than informational.
Therefore, to accurately simulate such search processes, we
avoid introducing any explicit information need. Thus, for
this search task, we did not provide any pre-prepared search
topic. This decision is motivated by the literature in sociol-
ogy [28] and information seeking and retrieval domains on
entertainment [13]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst time that an entertainment-based search task is simu-
lated in this way. The simulated search scenario for ENA
task was as follows: “Imagine you are working in a factory
as a night-guard. You have just ﬁnished your routine checks
and will be taking out more checks shortly. You are tired
so you decide to watch some videos to wake yourself up and
make yourself ready for your next round of checks.” Each
participant was asked to ﬁnd as many relevant videos as
possible that make them feel excited.

3.2.4 ENM Task

This search task simulates the entertainment-based search
intent where searchers adjust their mood. Similar to ENA
task, searchers engage in such search processes with hedonis-
tic need rather than informational. Therefore, to accurately
simulate such search processes, we avoid introducing any
explicit information need. Thus, similar to ENA task, we
did not prepared any speciﬁc search topic. The simulated
search scenario for ENM task was as follows: “Imagine your
boyfriend/girlfriend is travelling and communication access
is very limited. It is now a few days since he/she has gone
and you are missing him/her very much. You are feeling
very sad and in order to change your mood, you have de-
cided to watch some videos.” Each participant was asked to

934ﬁnd as many relevant videos as possible that make them feel
happy.

participants had to explicitly indicate the relevance of the
video.

3.3 Apparatus

For our experiment we used one desktop computer, equipped

with a monitor, keyboard and mouse. The computer pro-
vided access to a custom-made search interface which al-
lowed the participants to perform their search tasks. The
interface was designed such that it logged participants’ desk-
top actions, such as starting, ﬁnishing and elapsed times for
interactions, mouse movement, and click-throughs using a
common system time. Finally, we used entry, post and exit
questionnaires in each session.

3.4 Questionnaires

At the beginning of the experiment, the participants were
introduced to an entry questionnaire, which gathered back-
ground and demographic information, and inquired about
previous experience with online videos, in particular, brows-
ing and searching habits including their intentions. At the
end of each task, the participants completed a post-task ques-
tionnaire, to elicit subject’s viewpoint on certain aspects of
the search process. The questions were divided into three
sections that covered the encountered task and the cogni-
tion and emotion aspects of the search experience. All of
the questions included in these questionnaires were a forced-
choice type. Finally, an exit questionnaire was introduced at
the end of the study. In this questionnaire we gathered in-
formation about the encountered system as well as the user
study in general: which task they preferred and why, and
their general comments about the user study.

3.5 Video Retrieval System

For the completion of the search tasks we used a custom-
made search environment (named VideoHunt) that was de-
signed to resemble the basic layout of existing search ser-
vices, while retaining a minimum of graphical elements and
distractions. VideoHunt works on top of Bing 2.0 API. For
every submitted query it returned a list of ﬁfty results (ten
results on each page), stripped of their title, snippet and
any other metadata. The title of a video was presented as
tooltip by moving the mouse over a particular video. Even
though this approach introduced our participants into artiﬁ-
cial search situations which diﬀer from real-life experiences,
it was a necessary trade-oﬀ for capturing the browsing action
of the user with the retrieved results.

3.5.1 Search Interface

VideoHunt applies a layered architecture approach, sim-
ilar to that adopted in [3]. The ﬁrst layer of the interface
is dedicated to supporting any interaction that occurs dur-
ing the early stages of the search process (such as query
formulation and search execution). Any output generated
during this phase is presented in the second layer. From
there, the participants could easily select and preview any
of the retrieved clips. The content of a clip is shown on a
separate panel, in the foreground, which corresponds to the
third layer of our system. The main reason behind this lay-
ered architecture was to isolate the viewed content from all
possible actions allowing us to separate the time spent view-
ing video from other actions such as browsing the retrieved
results or formulating queries. Upon viewing the clip, the

3.5.2 User Tracking and Logging

All user actions were monitored and logged by the search
interface including their queries and clicks, as well as the
length of time spent watching a clip, expanding the result list
and formulating a query. In addition, as it has been shown
that mouse movements are correlated with user gaze [17],
the system captured mouse events to determine the amount
of time the user spent on each retrieved result item. This
information was all captured in a log ﬁle allowing for easy
association of the log information with the corresponding
questionnaire responses.

3.6 Procedure

The user study was carried out in the following manner.
The formal meeting with the participants took place in the
laboratory setting. At the beginning of the session the par-
ticipants were given an information sheet which explained
the conditions of the experiment. They were then asked to
sign a Consent Form and were notiﬁed about their right to
withdraw at any point during the study, without aﬀecting
their legal rights or beneﬁts. Then, they were given an Entry
Questionnaire to ﬁll in.

The session proceeded with a brief tutorial on the use of
the search interface with a short training task. After com-
pletion of the training task, each participant had to com-
plete four search tasks (explained in Section 3.2), one for
each level of search process intentions (see Section 3.1). To
negate the order and fatigue eﬀects we counter-balanced the
task distribution using a Graeco-Latin Square design. The
subjects were asked every time to provide judgment for any
video that they watch, and were given 10 minutes to com-
plete their task, during which they were left unattended to
work. At the end of each task, the subjects were asked to
complete a post-task questionnaire. Questions in the post-
task questionnaire were randomised to avoid the eﬀect of
fatigue. Between each task, a cooling-oﬀ period was applied
to avoid the carry-over eﬀect. An exit questionnaire was
administered at the end of the session. Finally, the partici-
pants were asked to sign a payment form, prior to receiving
the payment of £12.

Each study took approximately 120 minutes to complete;
this is from the time they accepted the conditions until they
signed the payment receipt. Users could only participate
once in the study. The total cost of the evaluation was £348,
including the cost of the pilot studies. A user study with the
procedure explained above was conduced over a period of 10
days from 16th to 26th of July 2012. The results of these
studies are presented in Section 4.

3.6.1 Participants

Participants consisted of 24 healthy participants with equal
gender distribution (12 female and 12 male) all under the
age of 41, with the largest group between the ages of 18-
23 (45.8%) followed by the group between ages of 24-29
(36%). Participants tended to have a high school diploma
or equivalent (4.16%), some college degree (4.16%), bache-
lor (41.66%) or graduate degree (50%). They were primar-
ily students (62.5%), though there were a number of self-
employed (16.6%), not employed (4.16%) and employed by
a company or organisation (16.6%).

9353.6.2 Pilot Studies

Prior to running the actual user study, a pilot study was
performed using 5 participants to conﬁrm that the process
worked correctly and smoothly. A number of changes were
made to the system based on feedback from the pilot study.
The changes consisted of modiﬁcations to the questionnaires
to clarify questions, modiﬁcations to the system to improve
logging capabilities and improvements to the tasks. After
the ﬁnal pilot, it was determined that the participants were
able to complete the user study without problems and that
the system was capturing all necessary data. One of the
important outcomes of the pilot study was that participants
preferred the questions where the search session was bro-
ken down into three phases (i.e. beginning, middle, and
end), compared to questions where a ﬁner granularity was
applied (e.g. broken down into four phases). Therefore, the
questionnaire was adapted accordingly. However, for better
granularity, the interaction log was divided into four phases.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Section 4.1, we ﬁrst discuss the task perception ex-
pressed in the questionnaire. Following this, we discuss our
analysis on the characteristics of the four search tasks out-
lined in Section 3.2; focusing on the cognition, emotion, and
interaction aspects. Finally, we discuss the predictability of
search task types based on features derived from the user
interaction with the system in Section 4.2.
4.1 Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis

4.1.1 Task Perception

Figures 1 shows the box plots for the qualitative analysis
of users’ perception of the four tasks (i.e. INS, INF, ENA,
and ENM). Each box plot reports data aggregated from 24
participants, along with ﬁve key statistics: the minimum,
ﬁrst, second (median), third, and maximum quartiles.5 We
performed an ANOVA test between measures obtained at
each phase, across four search tasks for each user to check
the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence among them. The test is
suitable for this data as we have four groups of data, there-
fore we need to compare four means and variances. We use
(*) and (**) to denote the fact that a measure had results
diﬀerent across four search tasks with the conﬁdence levels
(p < 0.05) and (p < 0.01), respectively.

In the post-task questionnaire we measured participants’
perception of their performed task in terms of the diﬃ-
culty of the task, the familiarity of the participant with the
task, the extent to which they found the task stressful, in-
teresting and clear by asking the following question “The
task we asked you to perform was [easy/stressful/interesting/
clear/familiar] (answer: 1: “Strongly Disagree”, 2: “Dis-
agree”, 3: “Neutral”, 4: “Agree”, 5: “Strongly Agree”)”. The
results shown in Figure 1 indicate that participants found
the INF task diﬃcult and stressful, followed by the INS task,
whereas they found other two tasks easy and not-stressful
(the diﬀerences were statistically signiﬁcant). The diﬀerence
in the answer provided by the participants for interesting,
clear and familiar measures is not statistically signiﬁcant.
In the post-task questionnaire we also asked the opinion of
the participants with respect to the following statement “I

“Strongly Disagree”, 2: “Disagree”, 3: “Neutral”, 4: “Agree”,
5: “Strongly Agree”)”. The results show that they found the
given time enough to do an eﬀective search task: INS: M=4.0
SD=0.88; INF: M=3.8 SD=0.96; ENA: M=4.0 SD=0.97;
ENM: M=4.3 SD=0.56 (the diﬀerences are however not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant across the tasks).

4.1.2 Main Results

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the line plots for the qualita-
tive analysis of users’ cognition, emotion, and interaction
aspects for the four search tasks (i.e. INS, INF, ENA, and
ENM). Each line plot reports the data aggregated from the
24 participants, along with the mean and error bar for three
phases of a search process: the beginning, middle and end.
We performed the ANOVA test at each phase to check the
signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence among the tasks at each phase.
We use (*) and (**) to denote the fact that a measure had
results diﬀerent across four search tasks with the conﬁdence
levels (p < 0.05) and (p < 0.01), respectively.

The key ﬁnding which emerged from the questionnaire
is that search tasks with diﬀerent intentions have varying
characteristics in terms of cognition, emotion, and interac-
tion aspects. From a cognition point of view, the complexity
and dynamic concepts associated with an information seek-
ing process do not hold for all four search intents, e.g. not all
the search processes have an information need which starts
from an ASK. From an emotion point of view, the uncer-
tainty principle of Kuhlthau [22] does not hold (at least for
the initiation phase) e.g. not all the search processes start

936from negative emotions, such as anxiety associated with the
realisation of lack of knowledge. However the end of the
search process tends to agree with Kuhlthau ISP model [21]
since, in the case of a successful search process, participants
express satisfaction and in other case anxiety and/or anger.
Though Kuhlthau’s ISP model is originally proposed for in-
formation seeking tasks, it is assumed to hold in IR scenar-
ios [23, 40]. The main result which emerged from interac-
tion analysis is that participants interact diﬀerently with the
search system throughout the search session when they have
diﬀerent intents. The interaction diﬀerences are in terms of
the characteristic of the submitted queries and interaction
behaviour with the retrieved results.
In the remainder of
this section we discuss each of these aspects in more details.

4.1.3 Cognition Aspect

To investigate the cognitive aspect of the our search tasks,
we study the diﬃculty of query formulation (associated with
complexity of search process), certainty of what to search for
and what is relevant (associated with the dynamic concept
of search process). Figure 2 presents the results for three
questions posed in the post-task questionnaire: (1) “At the
[beginning/Middle/End] of the search session, I was certain
about what I was going to search for.”, (2) “At the [begin-
ning/Middle/End] of the search session, I had diﬃculty for-
mulating queries.”, and (3) “At the [beginning/Middle/End]
of the search session, I didn’t have a clear idea what videos
would be relevant.” (answer: 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Dis-
agree, 3: Neutral, 4: Agree, 5: Strongly Agree).

The ﬁndings show that for the INS task, at the early
stage of the search session participants experience uncer-
tainty of what to search for and have only a vague idea
about what videos would be relevant. As they progress
through the search session, their uncertainty decreases and
their concept of relevant videos becomes more clear. For-
mulating queries also becomes less diﬃcult as they progress
through the search session. The cognitive process reported
for the INS task follows the literature in the information
seeking and retrieval community such as Belkin et al. [7]
and Kuhlthau [22].

In contrast to INS, for the INF task, the ﬁndings show
that participants at the beginning of the search session expe-
rience a high level of certainty, having little problem formu-
lating queries and knowing what video would be relevant. As
they progress through the search session, the uncertainty in-
creases, formulating queries became more diﬃcult and what
a relevant video would be becomes more vague. Although
the cognitive state at the later stage of the INF task is a
by-product of the fact that they were unsuccessful in their
search task, the cognitive state at the early phase of the
search process is contrary to general assumptions in the IR
community.

Finally, for the ENM and ENA tasks, the results show
a consistent level of certainty throughout the search ses-
sion. Although the ENA task is similar to INS in terms
of answers given to the “diﬃculty of formulating queries”
and “vagueness of the concept of relevance” questions, the
ENM task shows consistent behaviour for all three questions
across diﬀerent phases, which indicates yet another cognitive
behaviour pattern.

4.1.4 Emotion Aspect

To investigate the emotion aspect of our search tasks, we
study participants’ emotion at three stages of the search
session using six Ekman emotions [11] plus neutral, anxiety
and satisfaction. Figure 3 presents the results for the posed
questions in the post-task questionnaire: (1) “At the [begin-
ning/Middle/End] of the search session I experienced [Sad-
ness/Happiness/Anger/Surprise/ Fear/Disgust/Anxiety/Sat-
isfaction/Neutral].” (answer: 1: Yes, 2: No).

The results for the INS task show that participants’ sat-
isfaction level increases as they progress through the search
session. Although this is inline with previous literature (i.e.
the increase of the feeling of satisfaction as a result of alle-
viating ASK), the results for anxiety is not inline with pre-
vious work, such as uncertainty principle of Kuhlthau [22].
This is because our ﬁndings show that the anxiety level for
the INS task at the beginning of the search session is low
and remains low throughout the session. Surprisingly, the
results show that for this task, the majority of participants
are neutral (experiencing no emotion) at the beginning of the
search session and as they progress through, they experience
emotion (reporting less neutral). In addition, we observe a
diverse range of emotion reported at the middle phase of the
INS search process (e.g. surprise, fear, disgust, anger) which
we assume is a result of the topics and/or watched videos,
rather than the search process itself.

For the INF task, the ﬁndings show a similar trend for
a neutral level, as with what we reported for the INS task.
However, we observe that for the INF task, anger constantly
increases as the search session progresses, whereas for the

937INS task, satisfaction increases instead. Experiencing anger
can be a result of the cognitive process participants go through
in their search session for this task. As we discussed earlier,
the participants did not succeed in completing this task,
hence the experience of anger is likely a result of this. In
addition, the anxiety level increases as participants progress
from the beginning to the middle phase of the search session,
but surprisingly, it decreases from the middle to the end of
the search session. This can be as a result of transforming
anxiety to other negative emotions, e.g. sadness or disgust.
For the ENA and ENM tasks, the results show that fewer
participants are neutral at the beginning of the search ses-
sion compared to INS and INF, and this number further de-
creases as participants progress through the search session.
The ﬁndings show that participants’ experience of happiness
for these two tasks are signiﬁcantly higher than the INS and
INF tasks, indicating the hedonistic meditation underlying
such processes. These ﬁndings conﬁrm Zillmann theory of
mood management [42]. Similar to INS, for both ENA and
ENM tasks, participants satisfaction level increases as they
progress through the search session, indicating that the un-
derlying need is getting satisﬁed. The results show that the
feeling of satisfaction can also be experienced if the search
task does not have a clear IN, which in these tasks relates
to a hedonistic need. Another interesting observation is the
variety of the emotions experienced at the beginning of the
search session for the ENM and ENA tasks. This shows
that it is possible that participants begin their search ses-
sion experiencing emotions other than anxiety or any other
negative emotions, as is the case for ENM (e.g. the feeling of
sadness) and ENA (e.g. the feeling of surprise). This partic-
ular result may be an artefact of our experimental settings
and needs to be explored further.

4.1.5 Interaction Aspect

To investigate the interaction aspect of our search tasks,
we study a number of features extracted from interaction
log data. As the distribution of the search task completion
time can be very diﬀerent, we aggregate the interaction data
for each quartile. For each phase, we ﬁrst calculated general
statistics such as the average number of clicked, liked, and
disliked videos, as well as the average number of times “Next
Page” and “Previous Page” buttons were clicked, the aver-
age number of documents the mouse hovered over, and the
average number of formulated queries. Then, we calculated
the average query formulation time, video viewing time, and
mouse hovering duration over the retrieved results. Finally,
we calculated the similarity of the submitted queries as well
as the similarity of the titles of the viewed videos. The sim-
ilarity value was calculated using cosine similarity. Figure 4
presents the results for the analysis of the interaction with
respect to the features explained above.

The analysis of interaction for the INS task shows that
participants at each phase formulate fewer queries in com-
parison to other tasks, and the number of issued queries
and the query formulation time decreases as they progress
through the search session. The query formulation time can
indicate the cognitive eﬀort required. Therefore, the re-
sults obtained for the query formulation time is inline with
what we observed from questionnaire results with respect
to the cognitive aspect of the INS task where the diﬃculty
of formulating queries decreases as the participants progress
through the search session. Another interesting aspect is

how they interact with the retrieved results. Participants
mainly visited videos present on the ﬁrst page, and checked
a relatively lower number of videos at each phase compared
to other tasks. The average video viewing time steadily in-
creases as well as the number of videos judged as relevant.
On the other hand, for the INF task we observe a diﬀerent
interaction behaviour pattern. The number of formulated
queries and the similarity between the formulated queries are
the highest among the four tasks across all four phases, while
the average query formulation time is the lowest. In contrast
to the INS task, participants not only visited the retrieved
results in the main page but also visited other results pages.
They have also checked a larger number of videos at each
phase. The time spent viewing selected videos was close
to zero, showing that they were certain of what they were
looking for and simply wanted to verify the selected video
was the correct one. This results holds for diﬃcult re-ﬁnding
task scenario (see Section 3.2) and may not hold for other
spectrum of such a task.

For the ENA and ENM tasks we observe that the num-
ber of formulated queries and the average query formula-
tion time are between that of the INS and INF tasks across
four phases. The greatest number of submitted queries is in
the ﬁrst phase, however from the second phase onwards the
number of formulated queries remains almost static. What
distinguishes the formulated queries between the ENA and
ENM tasks is the similarity of the formulated queries at each
phase. For the ENA task the similarity of formulated queries
decreases as the search session progresses, whereas for the
ENM task the similarity of formulated queries and the num-
ber of formulated queries follows a similar trend across all
phases. Another aspect of interaction history which diﬀer-
entiates between the ENA and ENM tasks is the way par-
ticipants interact with the retrieved results. For the ENA
task, similar to the INS task, the visited documents were
mainly from the ﬁrst page across all phases, whereas for the
ENM task, participants visited results from other pages as
well, in particular during the third phase.

The next question this work addresses is whether we can
learn a model from such interactions so that we can accu-
rately predict the search task intentions. Furthermore, to
what extent can we accurately predict search task intentions
through the search process?

4.2 Prediction of Search Task Intentions

As discussed in Section 1, identiﬁcation of the intentions
behind the search processes can help search engines to better
satisfy users’ needs. Therefore, in this section, we investigate
our second research question on whether the search intents
can be modelled to predict given searchers’ interaction data
with the system. For this purpose, we used the set of features
extracted from interaction log data explained in Sections
4.1.5.

For our four search intents, we have a multinomial clas-
siﬁcation problem where the classes are “IN S” (indicating
the participant had information seeking), “IN F ” (indicating
the participant had information ﬁnding), “EN A” (indicat-
ing the participant had emotion need by adjusting arousal
level), and “EN M ” (indicating the participant had emotion
need by adjusting mood). We used SMO, an implementation
of SVM in Weka,6 to discriminate between the four classes

explained above. We trained our models using a normalised
polynomial kernel which in the majority of cases outper-
formed other SVM kernels (e.g. polynomial and radial-basis)
based on our analysis, not presented due to the space limits.
Table 2 shows the classiﬁcation performance averaged over
the 24 participants of the study at diﬀerent phases of the
search process. We measured the accuracy of the model
(i.e.
fraction of items in the test set for which the mod-
els’ predictions were correct) using 10-fold cross-validation.
We obtained more than 100% improvement over a model
based on the discrete uniform distribution. The results in-
dicate that at each phase of the search process we are able to
successfully predict the search task intentions given the fea-
tures extracted from interaction logs. The accuracy of the
prediction increases as the searcher progresses through the
search session. Our ﬁndings indicate that it is possible to
build eﬀective intention-aware search technologies in which
the retrieved results and provided functionality adapt to the
needs of the user.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we investigated the cognitive, emotion, and
interaction aspects of four search tasks namely information
seeking (INS), re-ﬁnding (INF), entertainment adjusting ar-
ousal level (ENA) and entertainment adjusting mood (ENM).
In order to do so, we devised four search tasks, each simu-

lating one of these intents. Using a video retrieval system
as a use case, we conducted a user study with 24 partici-
pants. We analysed the characteristics of each aspect across
diﬀerent phases of the search process. Our ﬁndings show
diﬀerences in cognition, emotion and interaction aspects of
search processes for diﬀerent search tasks.
In particular,
from a cognition point of view, the complexity and dynamic
concepts associated with an information seeking process do
not hold for all four search tasks types, e.g. not all the
search processes have an information need which starts from
an ASK. The cognitive process reported for the INS task
shows a parallel with prior ﬁndings in the information seek-
ing and retrieval community such as Belkin et al. [7] and
Kuhlthau [22]. In contrast, for the INF task, the ﬁndings
show that participants at the beginning of the search ses-
sion experience a high level of certainty, having little prob-
lem formulating queries and knowing what video would be
relevant. Finally, for the ENM and ENA tasks, the results
show a consistent level of certainty throughout the search
session.

From an emotion point of view, the uncertainty principle
of Kuhlthau [22] does not hold (at least for the initiation
phase) e.g. not all the search processes start from negative
emotions, such as anxiety associated with the realisation
of lack of knowledge. However the end of the search pro-
cess tends to agree with Kuhlthau ISP model [21] since, in
the case of a successful search process, participants express
satisfaction and in other case anxiety and/or anger. Sur-
prisingly, the results show that for INS task, the majority of
participants are neutral (experiencing no emotion) at the be-
ginning of the search session and as they progress through,
they experience emotion (reporting less neutral). For the
INF task, the ﬁndings show a similar trend for a neutral

level, as with what we reported for the INS task. For the
ENA and ENM tasks, the results show that fewer partici-
pants are neutral at the beginning of the search session com-
pared to INS and INF, and this number further decreases as
participants progress through the search session.

From an interaction point of view, the main result which
emerged from analysis is that participants interact diﬀer-
ently with the search system when they have diﬀerent search
tasks. The interaction diﬀerences are in terms of the charac-
teristic of the submitted queries and interaction behaviour
with the retrieved results. For the INS task, the ﬁndings
show that participants at each phase formulate fewer queries
in comparison to other tasks. Participants also mainly vis-
ited videos present on the ﬁrst page. In contrast to the INS
task, for the INF task, the number of formulated queries
and the similarity between the formulated queries are the
highest among the four tasks across all four phases. In addi-
tion, participants not only visited the retrieved results in the
main page but also visited other results pages. What dis-
tinguishes the formulated queries between these two tasks is
the similarity of the formulated queries at each phase.

We further study the possibility of predicting search in-
tents at diﬀerent phases of a search process, given features
extracted from interaction log data. We have achieved more
than 100% improvement over our baseline (discrete uniform
distribution) on our search intents prediction task, given
searchers’ interaction data. Discrete uniform distribution
is a na¨ıve baseline, however there are no previous studies for
comparison. Our prediction accuracy sets the baseline for fu-
ture studies. The features used for our prediction are compu-
tationally inexpensive and easy to calculate. A more exhaus-
tive exploration of features will be studied in future work.

The major implication of our work is in developing eﬀec-
tive intent-aware search technologies. Given the fundamen-
tal diﬀerences in cognition, emotion and interaction aspects
of the studied search intents, the next step can be to de-

velop techniques facilitating eﬀective seeking processes and
in turn satisfying searchers. In addition, search behaviour
characteristics at various phases can be easily detected and
exploited for predicting user intents. This may open up av-
enues for revisiting current intent detection approaches.

Finally, the ﬁndings of this paper are limited to the video
retrieval domain and we do not generalise it to other do-
mains. Even though signiﬁcant diﬀerences in cognition, emo-
tion and interaction were detected across diﬀerent search
task types, we acknowledge the limitation of a lab-based
study. However, our ﬁndings motivate the exploration of
similar hypotheses in other domains.
In future work, we
plan to evaluate additional features to improve our predic-
tion accuracy. Further, we want to continue to study how
understanding search sessions can be leveraged to improve
user satisfaction measures, and possibly build search engines
that adapt based on user search process intentions.
