Programme Chairsâ€™ Welcome 

 
It is our great pleasure to present you the technical programme of WWW 
2013, that, for the first time, is held in South America. The call for papers 
attracted  a  breath-taking  number  of  more  than  1250  abstracts  that  were 
converted to 831 full paper submissions. A program committee of 661 PC 
members and 316 supporting reviewers evaluated these papers. Based on 
almost 3,000 reviews and meta-reviews, that is, 3.6 reviews per paper on 
average,  as  well  as  many  discussions  held  online,  plus  a  two  full  days 
meeting with most of the 23 track chairs, we decided upon the final list of 
accepted full papers. At the end, 125 papers, only 15% of the submissions, 
could be accommodated in the technical programme. 

The submissions came from 50 countries all around the world, with 24 of them represented in the 
final program. The top 6 paper contributors were USA (297), China (110), Germany (54), United 
Kingdom (39), India (36), and Brazil (31). However, the top 6 countries with better acceptance 
rates were Israel (39%), Austria (24%), Italy (24%), Switzerland (24%), United Kingdom (22%), 
and  United  States  (21%).  These  papers  represent  a  well-balanced  mix  over  the  12  tracks  listed 
below. Though the different tracks received very different numbers of submissions, our principal 
selection criterion was quality. That is, we neither enforced a proportional share of acceptances 
among the tracks, nor did we favor tracks with lower numbers of submissions. The corresponding 
submission and acceptance numbers per track are the following:

We hope that you will find the resulting program interesting and thought provoking and that the 
conference will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and 
practitioners from institutions around the world. Rio de Janeiro should do the rest.
