ABSTRACT
A problem facing many textbook authors (including one of the au-
thors of this paper) is the inevitable delay between new advances in
the subject area and their incorporation in a new (paper) edition of
the textbook. This means that some textbooks are quickly consid-
ered out of date, particularly in active technological areas such as
the Web, even though the ideas presented in the textbook are still
valid and important to the community. This paper describes our
approach to building a companion website for the textbook Hyper-
media and the Web: An Engineering Approach. We use Bloom’s
taxonomy of educational objectives to critically evaluate a number
of authoring and presentation techniques used in existing compan-
ion websites, and adapt these techniques to create our own compan-
ion website using Semantic Web technologies in order to overcome
the identiﬁed weaknesses. Finally, we discuss a potential model
of future companion websites, in the context of an e-publishing,
e-commerce Semantic Web services scenario.

INTRODUCTION

The textbook Hypermedia and the Web: An Engineering Ap-
proach [15] (co-authored by Wendy Hall, one of the authors of
this paper) describes in detail a principled approach to the design,
production, and maintenance of large hypermedia applications; a
resource which we feel ongoing activity in Web application de-
sign [5, 24, 25] demonstrates is still valid (and potentially valuable)
in the context of the Web engineering community. However, in

the rapidly evolving ﬁeld of Web research, much of the textbook’s
background and research-related content (approx. 50% of the ma-
terial), although perhaps useful for newcomers to the ﬁeld, is now
out of date. To address this problem, we decided to try and bring
the textbook up to date by building a “companion website”1 which
would extend the coverage of the textbook and demonstrate how
more recent work in the community still ﬁts in with the framework
for hypermedia engineering it proposes.

2. TEXTBOOKS AND BLOOM’S

TAXONOMY

A primary goal of the Hypermedia and the Web textbook, as with
many textbooks, is to educate, and material aimed at a wide range
of readership proﬁles, including researchers, practitioners, design-
ers, managers, information experts and students, is covered.
In
1956, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom chaired a com-
mittee charged with developing a classiﬁcation system that cap-
tured the intellectual behaviour important in learning [3]. The re-
sulting hierarchy of intellectual skills involving the acquisition and
use of knowledge in the cognitive domain2, generally referred to as
Bloom’s Taxonomy, categorises cognitive learning objectives rang-
ing from simple recall to the ability to judge and evaluate material
(Table 1).

In the context of this paper, Bloom’s taxonomy gives us a way of
1A term used in popular Web parlance to describe a site which is
intended to function as a supplement to a non-electronic resource
such as a textbook.
2Bloom and his colleagues actually identiﬁed and delineated three
overlapping domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor; we
focus here on the cognitive domain.

365describing and critiquing the features that companion websites of-
fer. We argue that it is valid to transfer the taxonomy from judging
students in the educational domain to judging websites in the com-
puter systems domain because the taxonomy describes observable
intellectual behaviour as opposed to abstract beliefs. Hence, we
can reasonably state that, for example, a website providing a list of
departmental contact information (telephone, email etc.) does little
more than facilitate a reader’s recall, whereas a website listing the
most inﬂuential researchers in a particular ﬁeld (with justiﬁcation)
could assist the development of a higher level evaluation skill.

Generally speaking, the process of authoring a textbook such as
Hypermedia and the Web incorporates each of the intellectual skills
listed in the taxonomy, from gathering and reading background ma-
terial (recall, comprehension) to “ﬁtting” the textbook together and
deciding what should and should not be included (synthesis, evalu-
ation). The “success” of a textbook could therefore be considered
as dependent on the ability of the authors to effectively communi-
cate their high level understanding of the subject matter in such a
way as to facilitate the reader’s higher-level learning objectives. In
this respect, we are interested in discovering the authoring and pre-
sentation techniques that could be employed to create “successful”
companion websites that extend their traditional, non-electronic,
counterparts. We therefore carried out a review of a number of ex-
isting companion websites in order to identify some of these tech-
niques.

3. REVIEW OF EXISTING COMPANION

WEBSITES

The aim of the review was to identify the techniques used to
extend the textbook and present online material. We then related
these techniques to the intellectual skills delineated by Bloom’s
taxonomy, in order to evaluate the learning support provided by
each technique. In total, 25 companion websites from a number of
different domains were reviewed; see Appendix A3. To better facil-
itate comparison of the websites, we have categorised the features
of the 25 companion websites into four main areas: text, hypertext,
student resources, and instructor resources.
3.1 Text features

Although more than half of the reviewed sites reproduce some
or all of the textbook content in electronic form, either as HTML
pages or PS/PDF ﬁles4, four of the sites provide an extended or up-
dated online text (DrugsBrain, KimBiology, ResStrateg, WebPub-
lish). InsAnatomy provides extended material in the form of hyper-
linked anatomy diagrams entirely separate from the original text-
book content (an anatomical dictionary).
3.2 Hypertext features

Almost all of the sites use the hierarchical structure of the text-
book as a (hypertextual) presentation device, with each page of the
website mapped to a chapter, section, or article/lecture in the case
of those textbooks representing a collection of works by different
authors. Exceptions are InsAnatomy and KimBiology.
InsAnatomy’s nodes are anatomy diagrams; John Kimball, the au-
thor of KimBiology, reveals his approach in the introduction to his
3These sites were selected randomly using Google searches and
resources such as the list of Online Science and Maths Textbooks

4Although note that some companion websites may not be pub-
lished by, or under the control of, the textbook authors, e.g. Fam-
Practic, ElemsStyle, StatsSqOne

companion website, which led him to break down the linear text-
book content into a number of concise “topics” (one per Web page):

It has always seemed to me that the many parts that
make up the subject of biology are related to each other
more like the nodes of a web than as a linear collection
of independent topics. So I believe that the power of
hypertext will be better suited to learning about biol-
ogy than is the linear structure of a printed textbook.

Over half of the companion websites use a linked table of con-
tents to allow readers quick access to the material. In the majority
of cases, the table of contents is reproduced directly from the text-
book, and linked to each node of the site (e.g. AmericGeog); in
the cases where the textbook content is not reproduced, the table of
contents serves as a means of accessing other resources related to
each part of the textbook (e.g. Geosystems, PowerTools). Again
InsAnatomy and KimBiology are the exceptions: InsAnatomy uses
a graphical table of contents based on the human body (e.g. head
! organs ! ear ! drum); KimBiology lists topic pages by cat-
egory (e.g. Animals, Behaviour, Biochemistry). Several sites also
provide a site-speciﬁc search engine as a further means of ﬁnding
relevant material (e.g. BrainWorks, MedMicrobi).

In terms of hypertext linking features, four types of linking prac-
tice were identiﬁed: tour links (move to next/previous node in a lin-
ear sequence — cf. Navigation links [11]), glossary links (subject-
speciﬁc terms in the material linked to deﬁnitions — cf. Expansion
links [11]), cross-reference links (related ideas in the material tied
together with associative [6, 18] links — cf. Resource links [11]),
and external links (links to related material on other websites —
cf. Resource links [11]). All sites which demonstrated tour linking
mirrored the linear sequence of the textbook: readers can follow
links to the next/previous chapter or section. KimBiology, the only
site which demonstrates a cross-reference linking strategy, not only
makes concrete non-linear relationships between the many differ-
ent topics, but also (in the majority of topics) explicitly suggests
that readers should carefully compare the current topic with several
other (linked) topics. Some companion websites provide a single
list of external links to accompany the entire textbook (e.g.
EricMeyCss), some present external links in the context of nodes
(e.g. WebPublish); in either case, the external links may be an-
notated (e.g. with indications of the target audience of the linked
material - BrainWorks).
3.3 Student Resources

Less than half of the companion websites provide resources for
students, peripheral to the textual content, in the form of exer-
cises, projects, or quizzes. Other resources provided include an
online answer checker (LightMattr), facilities for students to email
their answers to instructors (PowerTools, Geosystems), and study
guides/workbooks (ResStrateg, WebPublish).
3.4 Instructor Resources

In half of the above cases, the student resources were accom-
panied by syllabi to assist instructors teaching courses related to
or based around the textbook. Other instructor resources include a
syllabus manager (Geosystems), instructor manuals (PowerTools,
LightMattr), and example lecture slides (MolBiology).

It is interesting to note that the Geosystems companion website
is just one of a number of sites with similar style and content ac-
companying textbooks by the Prentice-Hall group of publishers,
indicating that a “framework” for building companion websites is
available for authors to “ﬁll” with supplementary material, the pop-

tems site hints at some of the possibilities of this “framework” ap-
proach for authors with little Web authoring experience to produce
resources which help readers both review the content of the text-
book and expand upon it:

nations for further exploration of the topic at hand,
along with a Net Search feature that helps you formu-
late your own customized Web searches.

Table 2 summarises the features of each companion website.

3.5 Companion Websites and Bloom’s

Taxonomy

Those companion websites which reproduce the textbook con-
tent, and/or provide devices such as a linked table of contents into
the material, glossary links, or a search engine could be consid-
ered to assist the reader’s recall and comprehension by offering
fast access to the material (although consider a linked table of con-

367Figure 1: Fragment of the “Hypermedia Engineering” ontology.

tents/search engine in comparison to a textbook index as a recall
device). However, the review also identiﬁed at least four author-
ing and presentation techniques which could facilitate the reader’s
progression to the higher-level educational objectives:

1. Update/extend the text itself. The authors produce revised ver-
sions of parts of the textbook which are then published on the com-
panion website; more recent work and ideas are synthesised and
evaluated into an extended online text (e.g. DrugsBrain, ResStrateg).
In terms of the reader’s learning objectives, this extended work
functions in the same way as the textbook, with the “success” of
the companion website depending on the ability of the author to
communicate their understanding of the topic in the context of the
newer material.

2. Integrate the textbook material with other (newer) resources
by linking to them. The authors provide external links to other rele-
vant online resources (e.g. EricMeyCss). Presenting these links in
conjunction with a particular topic or part of the book (WebPublish,
KimBiology) or annotating the links with a short description of the
target resource (BrainWorks) may better enable readers to analyse
the linked material in conjunction with the textbook, but the au-
thors themselves do not synthesise the new material into a coherent
whole and so therefore this technique may be less effective than
(1).

3. Use hypertextual devices to expose the underlying organisa-
tional structure of the material. The authors use associative links
to make explicit the connections between related topics that could
not otherwise be easily expressed in the traditional (non-electronic)
textbook medium (KimBiology). This may be more effective than
(2) if newer material is synthesised into the hypertext structure, but
requires the authors to construct a non-linear information structure.
4. Create exercises which explicitly help readers assess their
learning achievements or help instructors assess their students.
The authors produce a series of exercises, quizzes, or projects de-
signed to assist readers in self-assessment. Some textbooks may
already contain such exercises; observed techniques which go be-
yond the non-electronic textbook medium include an online answer
checker (LightMattr) and automated facilities for student readers
to email their answers to their instructor (e.g. Geosystems). Other
student resources, such as study guides (ResStrateg, WebPublish),

may also help readers focus on the analysis, synthesis, and eval-
uation of key topics (in particular Geosystem’s essay and critical
thinking exercises). By the same token, instructor resources such
as sample syllabi (Geosystems) and manuals (LightMattr, Power-
tools) may assist instructors in guiding their students through the
spectrum of learning objectives.

Admittedly the ﬁrst and fourth techniques do not rely on the Web
publication medium - revised editions of textbooks and companion
“teaching packs” have been the norm since long before the Web
(indeed, many textbooks already include exercises for readers); it
is only with the widespread adoption of the Web that such revisions
and resources can be published quickly and (potentially) reach a
wider audience (although copyright restrictions or “commercial”
motivations may limit the adoption of this distribution method6).

Even so, each of the four techniques are susceptible to problems
with extensibility related to authoring effort. If the author adopts
technique 1 or 2, the text/links must be revised whenever relevant
new material is published in order to keep up to date. Similarly,
creating a non-linear information structure (technique 3) which in-
corporates this new material may also be problematic [17]. Drugs-
Brain contains direct evidence of this problem in its explanatory
text: “the links to the glossary and bibliography were still more
complex because each of the several hundred entries had to be iden-
tiﬁed as a target so the text could be linked to it”.

Exercises and assessments (technique 4) also need to take new
material into consideration, and may need to be individually created
for each type of reader (recall the diverse target readership for Hy-
permedia and the Web outlined in Section 2) and knowledge level.
Although frameworks such as that provided by Prentice-Hall (e.g.
Geosystems) may reduce the effort of actual HTML programming,
the fact remains that each of these essentially “static” techniques
must be hand-crafted and continually updated by the authors.
6But note L. Hamilton and C. Timmons’ explanatory text to Drugs-
Brain: “As an example of how a reverse spin can be put on almost
anything, we were approached by a textbook editor last week, via
e-mail, to inquire if we wanted to publish this [extended, online]
book in hard-copy”.

media Engineering” ontology.

4. COMPANION WEBSITES AND

THE SEMANTIC WEB

One of the visions of the Semantic Web [2] is the emergence
of a “services architecture” [16] advertising the services of “tril-
lions of small specialised reasoning services” [8] operating across
a knowledge-enriched Web. Why do these visions make us keen to
investigate the Semantic Web as a technology for building compan-
ion websites? We reason that in both the construction of a hyper-
text which exposes the underlying organisational structure of the
textbook (and related) material, and the formulation of assessment
exercises for students, the authors hold implicit knowledge about
the nodes they are creating. For example, the topic to which a par-
ticular node refers and the relationships between that topic and oth-
ers; the target audience of an assessment exercise, including the re-
quired intellectual skills and prerequisite knowledge. We envisage
this information modelled by an ontology, acquired from the au-
thor, and made available to machine-based Semantic Web services
whose reasoning over a number of distributed companion websites
provides the reader with an integrated, hypertextual view of the on-
line material which takes into consideration their background and
knowledge levels.
4.1 Related Work: Existing Semantic Web

Technology

A number of tools for building the Semantic Web have recently

been put forward, and can be related to Bloom’s taxonomy.

COHSE [1] uses a ontology of the linguistic terms in the domain
of interest (e.g. a thesaurus modelling the relationships between
different terms) to add links to Web pages from that domain. Us-
ing a semantic model of the terms used in a document, the sys-
tem is able to make decisions about which links to present to the
user, such as suggesting links to resources describing a broader
concept in the absence of available resources describing the spe-
ciﬁc term appearing in the document. schraefel [22] argues that the
weakness of COHSE (and similar systems such as MagPie [7] and
CREAM [12]) is that the system operates at the lowest levels of
Bloom’s taxonomy: identifying concepts in a document and giving
the reader access to them merely helps the reader recall facts from
the knowledge base.

OntoPortal [19] introduced the notion of “ontological hypertext”,
in which the underlying domain ontology was exposed to the user
as an orientation device in order to provide a principled and struc-
tured approach to navigating the interconnected knowledge held by
the portal. Such an approach to knowledge presentation may bet-

(dotted lines show instances).

ter assist the development of higher level intellectual skills, such
as comprehension (through the presentation of related knowledge
in context), and analysis (through the revealing of the underlying
organisational structure). ESKIMO [14] adopted a similar portal-
based approach, but in addition used bibliometric-based inferenc-
ing services to derive additional facts from the knowledge base (e.g.
allowing the user to discover who are the experts in Hypertext?).
ScholOnto [23] provided a framework for a community to con-
struct a network of claims describing their contributions, and the
contributions of others, using an ontology of rhetorical relations.
Reasoning services which derive trends and patterns from these
claims may better reﬂect the “real-world” opinion, being grounded
in human-authored beliefs.

5.

IMPLEMENTATION AND
FUTURE WORK

We have built a companion website for the Hypermedia and
the Web textbook which leverages, using Semantic Web technolo-
gies, some of the techniques we identiﬁed in Section 3.5 for build-
ing “successful” companion websites. We also discuss a practical
model for future developments of our companion website in the
context of a thriving e-commerce, e-publishing, Semantic Web ser-
vices architecture.
5.1 Modelling the Textbook

The ﬁrst step was to model the concepts in the textbook. Follow-
ing John Kimball’s (KimBiology) lead, we broke the linear text-
book down into a number of concise topics — however, rather
than mapping these topics directly to HTML web pages, we used
them to form the concepts in a “Hypermedia Engineering” ontol-
ogy modelled using Prot´eg´e7 [20]. By carefully reading the text,
we distilled the key relationships between the identiﬁed concepts,
and captured them in our ontology (Figure 1).

We were also keen to capture the different “content types” of
knowledge unit available in the textbook (e.g. a concept has at least
one description, summary, example, or illustration associated with
it) and readership proﬁles (e.g. a concept description/summary
etc. may be written with a practitioner, student, or instructor in
mind) in our ontology (Figure 2). We also introduced the notion of
Providers, with each knowledge unit being “provided by” a Provider
instance (Figure 3). To bootstrap the system, we have included a
number of knowledge units from three different providers: the Hy-

and implementation, we were later frustrated by the lack of support
for multiple instancing (Figure 3).

permedia and the Web textbook itself, the HyperBank case study
from the textbook, and material from the more recent WebML Web
engineering initiative8. In order to provide a basic means of nav-
igating through the site, a guided path was created through each
provider’s material, independent of the ontological relationships
between concepts [9] (Tour concept in Figure 2).
5.2 System Architecture

Figure 4 illustrates the current architecture of the Hypermedia
and the Web companion website. Our ontology (exported from
Prot´eg´e to RDF Schema) and instances (exported to RDF) are stored
and accessed through the 3store RDF storage and query engine [13],
a robust and scalable knowledge base for the Semantic Web9. User
interaction currently takes place via the services of a HyperBook
“agent”10, which enlists a number of simple services operating over
the 3store database (Table 3) in order to construct a Web document
based on the user request (Figure 5). As well as rendering the con-
tent of the current topic, the page also orients the reader within the
guided tour, and provides links to related topics, as captured by the
ontology. The reader also has the option of switching the ‘view-
point’ of the topic to that of a different provider (the provider of the
currently displayed topic is always visible at the top of the page).

website.

10In this context, we use the term agent to describe simply a com-
puter program which constructs information presentations at the re-
quest of the user; we hope to move towards agent-based Semantic
Web services [10].

5.3 An E-commerce, E-publishing Semantic

Web Scenario

Figure 6 illustrates how our vision of the future of companion
websites in the Semantic Web leverages the advantages of a ser-
vices architecture: “loosely-coupled distributed systems which
adapt to ad-hoc changes by the use of service descriptions that en-
able opportunistic service discovery” [10].

5.3.1 Publishing Model

Providers (e.g.

textbook authors, textbook publishers) publish

semantically enriched companion website content in distributed
knowledge bases (C). As in the case of Geosystems, the textbook
publisher may provide a publishing platform to assist authors of
their textbooks.

5.3.2 Advertising agent services to the user

A number of “agent-based services” [10] (A) register with a dis-
covery service (B) the types of service they offer to particular user
stereotypes [21]. When a user visits a particular companion web-
site (in the traditional way, by entering a URL or following a link),
and is assigned an initial stereotype, the available services for that
stereotype and proﬁle are advertised. The user’s proﬁle information
may be retrieved from a user proﬁle knowledge base if the user has
previously registered.

In this example, the user is a Year 2 Student, and therefore is

offered the services of two agents:

(cid:15) The Revision Notes agent dynamically constructs revision
exercises based on the user’s selected topic, and their back-
ground knowledge)

(cid:15) The HyperBook agent is an extension of the agent described
in the previous section, which takes into consideration the
background knowledge of the user when generating pages
for the companion website and uses a variety of “adaptive
hypertext” techniques [4] to present the most appropriate in-
formation.

5.3.3 User contracts agent to compile required com-

panion website “view”

Acting on behalf of the user, the chosen agent negotiates with
a number of Semantic Web services [16] (D) operating over the

370Figure 5: A page from the Hypermedia and the Web, generated by the HyperBook agent using data provided by several Semantic Web
services (labelled).

provider knowledge bases — advertised through a discovery ser-
vice (E) — in order to retrieve the most valuable information for
the user’s current requirements.

In the example in Figure 6, the user has enlisted the services of
the Revision Notes agent to construct a series of questions about
Design in Hypermedia Engineering, to help revise for an upcom-
ing test on a course based on the Hypermedia and the Web text-
book. The Revision Notes agent requests knowledge units created
for Year 2 Students to self-assess their knowledge of Design and
related concepts (according to the ontological relationships) from
the Questions service (a service specialising in providing exercises,
quizzes and other assessments).

The agent may negotiate with multiple, rival, Questions services
for this information, e.g.
trading coverage for questions on key
topics only (the student has left revision to the last minute!), or
negotiating provider fees — buying in bulk from Provider A may
get more questions for less, but is Provider B (who does not offer
bulk buy options) more relevant to the student (appearing as it does
in the list of core texts for the course)?

5.3.4 Further Examples

The Revision Notes agent working on behalf of an Instructor
who wishes to compile a test on Design operates in a similar way,
but negotiates for questions intended to help instructors assess stu-
dent knowledge within the “trust” layer of the Semantic Web [2]
to ensure that the “instructor” isn’t actually an enterprising student
trying to ﬁnd the answers to the upcoming test!

As another example, the Lecture Slides agent, acting on behalf
of an Instructor wishing to compile a series of slides for a half-hour
lecture on Hypermedia in the context of Hypermedia Engineering
to be given to Year 1 Students, favours any content that can be ob-
tained on related topics from Illustration services, but falls back on

the Summary services, or even (as a last resort) Description ser-
vices (possibly further enlisting a Summarisation service to reduce
the information to a more manageable size given the constraints of
the target presentation format), in order to provide coverage of the
key topics.

6. CONCLUSION

This paper has reported the latest efforts of a project to design
and build a companion website which helps keep the textbook Hy-
permedia and the Web: An Engineering Approach (published in
1999) up to date with recent technological advances in the Web
Engineering ﬁeld. This paper has two main contributions. First we
have reviewed 25 companion websites from a variety of different
domains and enumerated the authoring and presentation techniques
which both extend the coverage of the text and help to facilitate
readers’ higher-level learning objectives (as delineated by Bloom’s
taxonomy). The review identiﬁed four such techniques:

1. Update/extend the text itself.

2. Integrate the textbook material with other (newer) resources

by linking to them.

3. Use hypertextual devices to expose the underlying organisa-

tional structure of the material.

4. Create exercises which explicitly help readers assess their
learning achievements or help instructors assess their stu-
dents.

We argued that these techniques offer little in the way of extensi-
bility; whenever new material is published, the author must update
the essentially ‘static’ content. The second contribution is therefore

371Figure 6: Our vision of the future of companion websites in the Semantic Web.

the proposal that the Semantic Web technologies may help over-
come, or at least reduce, the effects of these weaknesses.

Our current companion website implementation demonstrates

how material from a number of different providers can be dynami-
cally synthesised with material from the Hypermedia and the Web
textbook by a (human-programmed) HyperBook agent, thereby “ex-
tending” the textbook to cover newer work. In this implementation,
the textbook authors need only create knowledge units describing
the new work (as opposed to synthesising the new material manu-
ally). The HyperBook agent also renders the underlying structure
of the material as ontological hypertext, facilitating the user’s anal-
ysis of the subject area.

In the future we hope that agent-based Semantic Web services
will dynamically construct other resources as part of the services
offered by our companion website, for example negotiating with
commerce-based agents to build a cost-effective list of revision
notes for a student or a comprehensive syllabus for a course in-
structor.
