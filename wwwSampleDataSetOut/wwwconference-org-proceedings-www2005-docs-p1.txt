Abstract 
The  key  property  of  the  WWW  is  its  universality:  One  must  be  able  to  access  it  whatever  the 
hardware  device,  software  platform,  and  network  one  is  using,  and  despite  the  disabilities  one 
might  have,  and  whether  one  is  in  a  “developed”  or  “developing”  country;  it  must  support 
information of any language, culture, quality, medium, and field without discrimination so that a 
hypertext link can go anywhere; it must support information intended for people, and that  intended 
for machine processing.   The Web architecture incorporates various choices which support these 
axes of universality. 

Currently the architecture and the principles are being exploited in the recent Mobile Web initiative 
in  W3C  to  promote  content  which  can  be  accessed  optimally  from  conventional  computers  and 
mobile  devices.  New  exciting  areas  arise  every  few  months  as  possible  Semantic  Web  flagship 
applications.    As  new  areas  burst  forth,  the  fundamental  principles  remain  important  and  are 
extended  and  adjusted.  At  the  same  time,  the  principles  of  openness  and  consensus  among 
international stakeholders which the WWW Consortium (W3C) employs  for new technology are 
adjusted, but ever-important.
