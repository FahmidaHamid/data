ABSTRACT
In online content voting networks, aggregate user activities
(e.g., submitting and rating content) make high-quality con-
tent thrive through the unprecedented scale, high dynamics
and divergent quality of user generated content (UGC). To
better understand the nature and impact of online content
voting networks, we have analyzed Digg, a popular online
social news aggregator and rating website. Based on a large
amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of
Digg. We study structural properties of Digg social network,
revealing some strikingly distinct properties such as low link
symmetry and the power-law distribution of node outdegree
with truncated tails. We explore impact of the social net-
work on user digging activities, and investigate the issues of
content promotion, content (cid:12)ltering, vote spam and content
censorship, which are inherent to content rating networks.
We also provide insight into design of content promotion
algorithms and recommendation-assisted content discovery.
Overall, we believe that the results presented in this paper
are crucial in understanding online content rating networks.

INTRODUCTION

The advent of user generated content (UGC) has dramat-
ically reshaped the landscape of Internet, shifting the role
of many websites from creating online content to provid-
ing facilities for Internet users to publish their own content
and empowering the role of Internet users from content con-
sumers only to content publishers, referees and consumers.
Online content rating networks are among such websites.
Example systems include YouTube [8], Flickr [3] and Digg [2]

where users share and rate videos, photos and news, respec-
tively.

Driven by unprecedented scale, high dynamics and diver-
gent quality of UGC, online content rating networks are
creating new viewing patterns, information (cid:12)ltering tech-
niques, content discovery channels and social interactions.
One striking feature in online content rating networks is that
popularity and availability of content are driven by users’
participation, i.e., rating or voting on content. For exam-
ple, Digg and Flickr have a front page that features popular
content which is representative of what a wide base of Inter-
net users like the most. Content displayed in the front page
often receives several million views per day, opening up op-
portunity for adversarial users and advertisers to game the
system [6]. The tension between the (cid:12)nite space of the front
page and proliferation of UGC, also calls for e(cid:11)ective con-
tent discovery channels for users to (cid:12)nd interesting content.
Moreover, online content voting networks include a social
network: users establish social links (e.g., friend and fan
links). The social network can a(cid:11)ect the way users share,
search, browse and rate content; on the other hand, users’
activities such as submitting and rating content can help
build up social links and thus boost their pro(cid:12)le within the
community [1].

To understand the nature and impact of online content
voting networks, we in this paper analyze Digg, a popular
social news aggregator and voting website. The main contri-
bution of this paper is an extensive trace-driven analysis of
users’ digging activities on submitted stories. To this extent,
we have collected a large amount of digg data spanning from
the launch of Digg (2004=12=01) to 2009=04=16. We have
also crawled the social network graph, more speci(cid:12)cally, the
large weakly connected component (WCC). To the best of
our knowledge, this work is the (cid:12)rst to extensively study user
voting activities on content, and impact of the social net-
work on content rating and vice versa. Our analysis yields
very interesting (cid:12)ndings regarding structural properties of
the social network, the distribution of user diggs, content
promotion, content (cid:12)ltering, content censorship and content
discovery.

The highlights of our work could be summarized as fol-

lows:

(cid:15) We analyze the structural properties of Digg social net-
work. Surprisingly, the Digg social network has strik-
ingly distinct properties from other previously studied
online social networks [20]: (1) It has low link sym-
metry; (2) The node outdegree distribution exhibits
power-law with a truncated tail; (3) It exhibits weak

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1039correlation of indegree and outdegree; (4) Nodes tend
to connect to other nodes with di(cid:11)erent degree from
their own.

(cid:15) Examination of our over 52 months worth of digg trace
data reveals stable digging activities across users: A
few users are very active in digging stories (e.g., a cou-
ple hundred diggs per day) while an overwhelming ma-
jority of users digg less than one story per day.

(cid:15) By analyzing the correlation of users’ social links and
their diggs, we show that: (1) Users digg more with
increasing number of fans (or incoming/fan links); (2)
Users digg more as the number of friends increases
until reaching 200 friends. Beyond that, there is no
strong correlation of the number of friend links and
diggs.

(cid:15) Investigation on inter-digg time intervals and entropy
distribution of user diggs indicates presence of digg
spammers. The (cid:12)ndings can be of great value to on-
line content voting networks like Digg in order to make
their story promotion algorithms resilient to vote spam.

(cid:15) The number of diggs and digg rate are in(cid:13)uential to
promotion of a story. More interestingly, we provide
evidence of content censorship in story promotion. We
also show that users are not equally in(cid:13)uential in story
promotion: A few users are more in(cid:13)uential due to
their high visibility in the community. The in(cid:13)uential
users could become source of system gaming.

(cid:15) We investigate impact of content (cid:12)ltering (including
the friends interface and story promotion) on users
viewing and rating content. We highlight that the
friends interface in(cid:13)uences those users with fewer num-
ber of friends, and the story promotion is substantially
in(cid:13)uential to users.

(cid:15) Leveraging our (cid:12)ndings, we provide insight into design

of the story promotion algorithm and a recommendation-
assisted content discovery mechanism that helps users
to (cid:12)nd interesting content.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-

tion 2 describes background on Digg and measurement method-
ology. We analyze structural properties of the social network
in Section 3 and user digging activities in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 provides related work and we conclude the paper in
Section 6.
2. BACKGROUND AND MEASUREMENT

METHODOLOGY

2.1 Background

Digg is a popular online news aggregation site where users
submit and rate stories. When a user submits a story, the
story is (cid:12)rst placed on the upcoming stories section, which is
the place where users browse recently submitted stories and
digg what they like the best. If a story receives enough diggs
and meets promotion requirements, the story gets promoted
and is moved to the popular stories section which we call the
front page. In the front page, stories are more visible to the
community and can receives several million visits per day.

Digg includes a social network: A registered user can in-
vite other registered users as her friends; a user can also
be befriended by other users who become her fans. The
friend and fan links create a directional graph among users.
Through the friends interface, Digg allows users to track
friends’ activities (e.g., stories they recently submitted and
voted for).
2.2 Measurement Methodology

To investigate structural properties of Digg social net-
work, we focus on the large weakly connected component
(WCC), structurally the most interesting part of a social
network [20]. Leveraging Digg APIs, our crawl of the WCC
started with the user \kevinrose", the founder of Digg and
inserted the user name into an initially empty queue. At
each step, our crawl script removed a user from the queue,
retrieved a list of the user’s friends and fans, and added un-
visited friends and fans into the queue. The crawl script
continued until the queue is exhausted. Digg limits the rate
at which a single IP address can download information. It
took about one week to crawl the WCC and The crawling
process ended on March 16, 2009.

For each user in the crawled graph we fetched her diggs
submitted between 2004=12=01 and 2009=03=16. We call
this digg data trace Primary Trace (PT). In addition, we
collected one month worth of digg data trace spanning from
2009=03=17 to 2009=04=16, which we call Secondary Trace
(ST). ST is used to examine correlation of the user graph
and user digging activities because: (1) the user graph was
evolving as users joined over the time period of PT; and
(2) the crawled graph is a snapshot of Digg social network
around 2009/03/16 and is assumed to be relatively stable
over the duration of ST.

Table 1 shows high-level statistics of the data we collected.
Note that both PT and ST contain all the diggs submitted
by all users in WCC within the speci(cid:12)ed period, and the
diggs submitted by users in WCC constitute 90:75% of total
diggs submitted by the entire community. This shows that
WCC is not only structurally the most interesting compo-
nent in the social network, but also logically the most valu-
able piece in analysis of user diggs.
3. ANALYSIS OF NETWORK STRUCTURE

In this section, we characterize the structural properties of
the Digg social network, to answer a major question: Does
it show similar structural characteristics with other online
social networks [17, 20]?

consistent with power-law networks.

3.1 Link Symmetry

Users create social links in online social networks. For in-
stance, a user may invite any other users to be her friends.
Upon acceptance of the invitation, the invitee may recipro-
cate by pointing back to the inviter (often without scrutiny),
thereby creating a high degree of link symmetry. Previous
studies [20, 17] have observed a signi(cid:12)cant level of reciprocity
(62 (cid:0) 100%) in Flickr, LiveJournal [4], YouTube, Yahoo!
360 [7] and Orkut [5].

Table 1 shows reciprocity of the Digg graph is 39:4%, far
lower than those of the aforementioned online social net-
works. The Web graph does not show a high level of link
symmetry among web pages, and thus search engines lever-
age this to identify reputed source of information to rank
search results (i.e., PageRank [22]). As will be discussed
later, our (cid:12)ndings suggest Digg possibly su(cid:11)ers Sybil at-
tacks by which attackers create many identities to digg a
story in order to surface it to the front page for various pur-
poses (e.g., advertisement and pro(cid:12)ts). We may leverage the
low link symmetry in Digg to defend against Sybil attacks
by using PageRank-like algorithms to rank users and weigh
their votes.
3.2 Power-law Node Degree

One striking property of online social networks is that
their node degree distribution follows a power-law. That is,
the majority of nodes have small degree while a few nodes
have signi(cid:12)cantly higher degree. Figure 1 shows the inde-
gree and outdegree complementary cumulative distribution
functions (CCDF) for Digg. The indegree distribution ex-
hibits a power-law. The most straightforward explanation
is the preferential attachment process: the probability of a
user i connecting to a user j is proportional to the number
of j’s existing fans (or incoming links). However, the out-
degree distribution does not have a power-law tail. Note a
sharp drop at the degree of 860. The explanation is: (1)
Digg users do not often reciprocate their fans by pointing
back (and thus creating friend links), as indicated by the low
link symmetry we have revealed; and (2) Digg user activities
are centered on submitting and digging stories, which are
more e(cid:11)ective than simply connecting to others in boosting
their pro(cid:12)les within the Digg community [1]. As shown in
Section 4.2, users digging more stories have higher indegree.
This may imply that digging stories increases one’s visibility
in the community, thus attracting more incoming links.

Figure 2 plots the distribution of incoming and outgo-
ing links across nodes in Digg graph. Digg shows similar
distributions for incoming and outgoing links. For example,

about 1:5% of users account for 60% of all incoming and out-
going links. The di(cid:11)erence between the two curves mainly
comes from the fact that a signi(cid:12)cant portion (55:21%) of
users do not have friends but many of them have fan links.
This further con(cid:12)rms our conjecture that digging stories is
more important than creating friend links in boosting one’s
visibility.
3.3 Correlation of Indegree and Outdegree

In social networks such as YouTube, Flickr and LiveJour-
nal, the nodes with high outdegree tend to have high inde-
gree. For example, in all these three networks, the top 1%
of nodes ordered by outdegree has a more than 65% over-
lap with the top 1% of nodes ranked by indegree [20]. The
left plot in Figure 3 shows that Digg exhibits less overlap
between the top x% of nodes ranked by indegree and outde-
gree. For instance, the top 1% of nodes ordered by outdegree
has a 58% overlap with the top 1% of nodes ranked by inde-
gree. We have extrapolated that many high-indegree users
have boosted their visibility to the community by submitting
and digging stories, instead of aggressively making friends.
In addition, we examined the indegree and outdegree of
individual nodes in Digg. The right plot in Figure 3 shows
the cumulative distribution of outdergee-to-indegree ratio
for Digg. The CDF for Digg di(cid:11)ers from those of YouTube,
LiveJournal and Flickr in two ways: (1) about 55:21% of
nodes have outdgree of zero; and (2) about 14:56% of nodes
have an indegree within 20% of their outdegree while the
percentage for the other three social networks is more than
50% [20]. In summary, Digg exhibits much weaker correla-
tion of indegree and outdegree than the other three social
networks. This can be explained by a much lower level of
link symmetry in Digg.
3.4 Link Degree Correlation

Which users tend to connect to each other in Digg? To
answer this question, we used the joint degree distribution
(JDD) which is approximated by the degree correlation func-
tion Knn. Knn denotes a mapping between outdegree and

the average indegree of all nodes connected to nodes of that
outdegree [20]: An increasing Knn implies a tendency of
higher-degree nodes to connect to other high-degree nodes
while a decreasing Knn indicates the opposite trend. The
left plot in Figure 4 depicts Knn for Digg. Unlike Flickr,
LiveJournal and Orkut showing the trend for high-degree
nodes to connect to other high-degree nodes observed in [20],
Digg exhibits di(cid:11)erent behavior, due to the \celebrity"-driven
nature. That is, there are a few extremely popular users in
Digg to whom many unpopular users link.

To further explore this phenomenon, we calculated the
assortativity coe(cid:14)cient r, a measure of the likelihood for
nodes to connect to other nodes with similar degree. The
assortativity coe(cid:14)cient r value lies between (cid:0)1 and 1; a
big r indicates tendency of nodes to link to nodes of similar
degree and a negative r implies that nodes tend to link to
nodes with very di(cid:11)erent degree from their own. We found
that the assortativity coe(cid:14)cient r for Digg is (cid:0)0:019.
3.5 Clustering Coef(cid:2)cient

Next, we explore connection density of the neighborhood
of a node, which is quanti(cid:12)ed by the clustering coe(cid:14)cient.
Formally speaking, the clustering coe(cid:14)cient of a node with
N neighbors is de(cid:12)ned as ratio of the number of directed
links existing between the node’s N neighbors and the num-
ber of possible directed links that could exist between the
node’s neighbors (N (N (cid:0) 1)). The clustering coe(cid:14)cient of
the Digg graph is the average of individual nodes’ clustering
coe(cid:14)cients, with a typical value of 0:218. This is consis-
tent with those of YouTube, Orkut, Flickr and LiveJournal
(ranging from 0:136 to 0:330) [20]. It shows that users in
social networks tend to be introduced to other users via mu-
tual friends, increasing the probability that two friends of a
single user are also friends. The right plot in Figure 4 shows
the clustering coe(cid:14)cients of nodes with respect to their out-
degree. Nodes of low outdegree have higher clustering coe(cid:14)-
cients, indicating signi(cid:12)cant clustering among low-outdegree
nodes. High-outdegree nodes, on the other hand, show much
lower clustering coe(cid:14)cients due to their large number of di-
verse friends.
3.6 Summary

While Digg social network shares some similar structural
properties (e.g., the power-law node indegree distribution
and clustering coe(cid:14)cient) with other studied social networks,
it has the following strikingly di(cid:11)erent properties:

(cid:15) Digg shows a much lower level of link symmetry, which
can be exploited to identify reputed source of diggs to
combat spammers and Sybil attacks.

(cid:15) The node outdegree distribution does not have a power-
law tail. This can be attributed to the low level of
link symmetry and user activities centered on submit-
ting and digging stories instead of aggressively creating
friend links in Digg.

(cid:15) Digg exhibits weaker correlation of indegree and out-
degree. Nodes with high outdegree do not necessarily
have high indegree.

(cid:15) Digg does not have a tendency of higher degree nodes
to connect to other high degree nodes. Instead, nodes
tend to connect to nodes with very di(cid:11)erent degree
from their own.

4. ANALYSIS OF CONTENT VOTING AC-

TIVITIES

Unlike many other online social networks that are cen-
tered on building social relationships and sharing informa-
tion, Digg, a news aggregator site, is centered around user
voting on submitted stories to make them popular or not.
Users vote on stories for di(cid:11)erent goals. Some users digg
stories they like the best and share them with other users;
some users digg stories as a means to boost their pro(cid:12)les
within the community (e.g., become a friend of the users
who submitted the stories they dugg); and some other users
attempt to game Digg to make some articles (e.g., adver-
tisement, and phishing articles) promoted to the front page
to receive several million page views per day (often for prof-
its). As a result, it is signi(cid:12)cantly important to examine
users’ voting activities which is not only helpful to under-
stand user behavior and how stories get promoted, but also
bene(cid:12)cial to system designs including story promotion algo-
rithms and resource allocations (e.g., promotion of stories
will attract more and more user attention including diggs
and comments which need more resources to handle).
4.1 Statistics of User Diggs

First, we quantify the total number of diggs and daily av-
erage number of diggs submitted by individual users in PT
and ST. Figure 5 depicts CCDFs of the total and daily av-
erage diggs1 across users. Several important observations
can be made: (1) The shapes of the two plots for daily diggs
closely match, implying stable digging activities across users.
(2) A signi(cid:12)cant portion of users do not vote. For example,
20:2% and 78:0% of users did not vote in PT and ST, re-
spectively. (3) A few users are very active in digging stories,
e.g., a couple hundred diggs per day; while an overwhelming
majority of users on average cast less than one vote per day.
For the overwhelming majority of users, since they digg in-
frequently, most of them probably follow a \read-then-digg"
pattern: Read an article (cid:12)rst and then digg it if they like
it. For those users passionate in digging stories, however,
they may exhibit a di(cid:11)erent pattern. We illustrate this by
an example. Suppose an active user diggs 200 stories per
day and follows a \read-then-digg" pattern. Also assume
that reading an article (probably also spending time (cid:12)nding
the stories) takes 2:5 minutes. Then, the active user has to

1The average diggs for a user is based on the time period
from the (cid:12)rst time the user dugg to the end time of the trace.
We believe it is more reasonable to begin with the (cid:12)rst time
the user dugg than the user’s registration time.

spend more than 8 hours a day. This is a large amount of
time invested in Digg unless we suspect the user of either not
following the \read-then-digg" pattern (e.g., digging stories
solely to boost her pro(cid:12)le in the Digg community) or using
an automatic script.

Thus, we analyze the time intervals between a user’s con-
secutive diggs. The left plot in Figure 6 displays PDF of
time intervals between consecutive diggs by users in PT.
Note that the time intervals follow a power-law distribu-
tion. Most of diggs by individual users are submitted close
in time.
In particular, about 35% of diggs are submitted
within one minute or less 2 after their previous diggs. Such
diggs unlikely result from the \read-then-digg" pattern be-
cause of the time to ((cid:12)nd and) read an article.

Diggs submitted by automatic scripts are most likely to
be close in time. Golder et al. have used 5 seconds as the
threshold of inter-message time for automatically generated
messages and manual ones [15]. They classify those Face-
book messages written within 5 seconds of the previous mes-
sages as spam. We do not intend to argue whether or not 5
seconds are an appropriate threshold to mark user diggs as
spam or to infer user diggs generated by automatic scripts.
The right plot in Figure 6 shows percentages of diggs sub-
mitted within 5, 10 and 60 seconds of inter-digg time. Both
PT and ST have similar characteristics: A signi(cid:12)cant por-
tion of diggs are indeed submitted close in time; for example,
over 12:75% of diggs are generated within 5 seconds of their
previous diggs.

Inter-digg time interval is important to characterize a user’s
digging behavior. A user whose diggs are very close in time,
very likely diggs a story not upon its content but for other
purposes. For example, to boost her pro(cid:12)le in the commu-
nity, a user diggs stories hoping story submitters to recip-
rocate by connecting to her; a user may follow her friends
to digg what they have dugg. Also, people are gaming Digg

ment on Digg by charging advertisers for a vote; users may
sell their votes to such service companies for pro(cid:12)ts, thereby
creating spam diggs.

We also conduct a complementary analysis that summa-
rizes the digging activity of each user by their entropies.
We group a user’s inter-digg times into 143 bins, by seconds
(1 (cid:0) 59), minutes (1 (cid:0) 59), and hours till 24 hours (1 (cid:0) 24,
inter-digg times over 24 hours are grouped into one same
bin). The user’s entropy is computed by

H(X) =

143

X

i=1

p(xi) log p(xi)

Where p(xi) denotes the probability of the user’s inter-
digg times falling into the i-th bin. Entropy here is a mea-
sure of inherent randomness in a user’s digging activity. Fig-
ure 7 plots distribution of entropies across users in ST. A
signi(cid:12)cant portion of users (over 0:2) have an entropy of
zero while a small fraction of users have very high entropies.
We expect that automatic scripts or any other form of au-
tomatic behavior would have a high entropy. The entropy
distribution reveals presence of digg spammers.

User-driven social content websites like Digg, should have
to identify and handle spam votes if they want to retain
democracy of content rating which is one of the driving
factors contributing to success of today’s user-driven social
content websites. We conjecture that user inter-digg time
intervals and entropy analysis may be used to detect spam-
mers, therefore making story promotion algorithms resilient
to spam diggs.
4.2 Correlation of User Diggs and Social Links

Next, we provide data to answer two questions: (1) Do
people digg more actively if they have more friends? (2) Do
people digg more actively if they are befriended by many
others? Figure 8 depicts the average number of diggs (the
left two plots) and the average number of daily diggs (the
right two plots) against the number of friends and fans per
user respectively for PT. We see that the number of friends
does in(cid:13)uence the users with up to 200 friends. That is,
people digg more as the number of friends increases until
reaching 200 friends. Beyond 200 friends, there is no strong
correlation of the number of friends and digging activity.
However, we observe strong correlation of the number of
fans and digging activity: People digg more with increas-
ing number of fans. This can be explained by three fac-
tors: (1) People increase their visibility to the community
through more diggs, thus attracting more users to connect
to them and to become their fans; (2) People with more

fans respond to \celebrity" pressure by digging more; and
(3) People with more fans are likely to have been in the
network longer, thereby accumulating more diggs. The (cid:12)rst
two factors are like the \chicken-and-egg" problem and it is
hard to tell which dominates. To investigate the last fac-
tor, i.e., impact of user age (the time since registration) on
the correlation of the number of fans and digging activity,
Figure 9 shows the average number of diggs vs number of
friends and number of fans in ST. ST minimizes noise of
the last factor in the correlation. Similar characteristics are
observed, though the correlation of the number of fans and
digging activity is slightly diluted.
4.3 Story Promotion vs User Diggs

The lifecycle of stories in Digg is as follows. A newly sub-
mitted story (cid:12)rst goes to the upcoming stories section, dis-
played in reverse chronological order of submission time. If
the story accumulates enough votes shortly and meets pro-
motion requirements, it will be marked as a popular story
and promoted to the front page, thereby becoming more
visible to the community and receiving more visits. Other-
wise, the story will be pushed down in the upcoming stories
section as it ages, thereby becoming less visible and (cid:12)nally
getting \buried".

While unrevealed to the public, the promotion algorithm
is crucial to Digg.
It should promote the content that a
wide base of users like the most; it should be resilient to
gaming [6] and Sybil attacks. For example, in ST we have
found some upcoming stories, a signi(cid:12)cant portion of whose
received diggs come from new voters who registered on the
same day of the story’s submission time. In the crawled Digg
graph, we have also found many users whose usernames only
di(cid:11)er in their trailing digits and whose registration times
are close in time. We do not intend to use these (cid:12)ndings
as evidence of Sybil attacks. But, the promotion algorithm
design should take attacks into account because the most

Figure 10: CDF of number of received diggs (left)
and CDF of scores (right) for upcoming (\circle")
and popular (\square") stories in ST. The number
of diggs for an upcoming story includes all diggs
received since the submission of the story until the
end time of ST; The number of diggs for a popular
story includes only the diggs received prior to its
promotion time.

pro(cid:12)table avenue for the attacks lies in the fact that the
promoted content receives several million visits per day.

To this end, we use ST to examine impact of user diggs
on story promotion 3. Speci(cid:12)cally, we have identi(cid:12)ed that
number of diggs and digg rate play in(cid:13)uential roles in story
promotion. The left plot in Figure 10 shows CDF of num-
ber of diggs for upcoming and popular stories in ST. Ap-
parently, the number of diggs strongly in(cid:13)uences whether a
story can become popular or not. Note that 92:1% of up-
coming stories received less than the cuto(cid:11) value of 15 diggs
while all popular stories received 15 diggs or more before
promotion. Surprisingly, 7:9% of upcoming stories received
same number of diggs as popular stories or even more (e.g.,
one upcoming story received 1; 936 diggs) but did not get
promoted. We conclude that the number of diggs is not the
only factor contributing to story promotion. Note that for
popular stories we consider only the diggs received before
their promotion while for upcoming stories we count all the
diggs received over the duration of ST. We have extrapo-
lated that digg rate, de(cid:12)ned as the number of diggs received
by a story for each hour, a(cid:11)ects promotion.

The left plot in Figure 11 shows CDF of promotion ages
across popular stories. We can see that most of stories
(88:4%) get their promotion at age of one day or younger.

3We believe Digg’s story promotion algorithm undergoes
changes. We suspect that the story promotion algorithm
has changed over the long duration of PT. Thus, using ST
we are able to more accurately characterize the behavior
of the promotion algorithm due to its short duration and
recency.

Figure 11: Left: CDF of promotion ages across pop-
ular stories in ST. Right: Average digg rates for up-
coming and popular stories in ST. Each data point
represents average dig rate for upcoming or popular
stories at each age (by hours).

All stories become popular within 3 days after submission.
We conclude that if a story will become popular, it will get
promotion very soon. This suggests that digg rate is in(cid:13)uen-
tial to promotion. The right plot in Figure 11 shows average
digg rates at each age (in terms of hours) for upcoming and
popular stories.
It only plots data up to 3 days since all
popular stories get promotion by age of 3 days. For a pop-
ular story, if it gets promoted at age of m hours, then its
diggs received after promotion are not counted and the story
is excluded from calculating the data points after m hours.
Simply put, we only show the digg rate prior to promotion
for popular stories. From the (cid:12)gure, we can see that popular
stories before promotion, receive a digg rate which is one or-
der of magnitude higher than that of upcoming stories. We
believe that the digg rate, particularly in the initial several
hours, is very important to story promotion. In other words,
if a story does not get su(cid:14)cient diggs at its early age, it will
lose visibility and (cid:12)nally get buried.

We suspect that Digg’s promotion algorithm treats each
individual vote equally. Otherwise, the promotion algorithm
is susceptible to gaming and Sybil attacks as attackers can
create many identities to vote for a story in order to advance
it to the front page. As discussed in Section 3.1, Digg shows
only 39:4% link symmetry far lower than those of other on-
line social networks (62% - 100%). Low level of link reci-
procity makes it not only di(cid:14)cult for attackers to foster trust
(friend) links from others, but also easy to identify reputed
source. Inspired by PageRank [22] to measure importance
of web pages, we used PageRank algorithm to weigh indi-
vidual diggs. First, we ran PageRank in the crawled graph
and computed a PageRank value wi for each user i. Then,
wi is used to weigh user i’s diggs. For an article A with m
votes, the score is calculated by score(A) = Xm
wk. The
right plot in Figure 10 shows CDF of scores for upcoming
and popular stories and it shows similar characteristics with
the left plot in Figure 10. One striking di(cid:11)erence is that
those upcoming stories which received more diggs than any
of popular stories are subsumed by the score curve of popular
stories. This indicates that many diggs on those upcoming
stories come from insigni(cid:12)cant users. Again, the digg rate
adversely a(cid:11)ects promotion of some upcoming stories with
scores comparable to those of popular stories. In the subse-
quent section, we will show other promotion-related factors.

most, which leads us to believe that Digg is a \democratic"
community: the voice of the majority is heard.

However, after examining a sample of upcoming stories
whose received diggs and digg rates are comparable to or
even more than those of popular stories, we have found ev-
idence of content censorship on advertisement, phishing ar-
ticles and articles \o(cid:11)ensive" to Digg. Figure 12 plots the
average number of diggs accumulated at di(cid:11)erent ages for
upcoming and popular stories as well as a censored story
(an article against diggbar, a Digg toolbar product). De-
spite that the diggs and digg rate of the censored story at
various ages are nearly one order of magnitude higher than
those of popular stories, it is still not promoted at the time
of writing (nearly two months after story submission). The
story will be unlikely promoted noticing the (cid:13)at tail of its
curve. Our (cid:12)ndings indicate that Digg buries stories by cen-
soring content before they are promoted to the front page.
Analysis of story promotion using PageRank to weigh
diggs in Section 4.3 implies that user diggs are not equally
assessed. Next, we examine ST to answer a question: Are
Digg users equally powerful or a few are more in(cid:13)uential?
For a user i, let Pi, P 0
i, and Ui denote the number of i’s
diggs on popular stories prior to their promotion (i.e., user
i’s diggs contribute to the promotion of the popular sto-
ries), the number of i’s diggs on popular stories after their
promotion, and the number of i’s diggs on upcoming sto-
ries, respectively. Then, we use digg success rate, de(cid:12)ned
, to measure user i’s digging power (i.e., capability
as
of making an upcoming story popular). Note that P 0
i is
disregarded in the digg success rate.

Figure 13 shows digging behavior of the users who dugg
in ST. Only 22:5% of the users in the Digg graph dugg on
stories as shown in Table 1. The x-axis denotes user ranks
ordered decreasingly by their Pi. It is straightforward that
the fraction of popular stories drops as the user rank de-
creases. The top 100 users each contributes to the promo-
tion of a signi(cid:12)cant portion (14:4 (cid:0) 34:6%) of the popular
stories by their diggs.

Two important observations can be made in this (cid:12)gure.
First, the top ranking users also have high fraction of total
stories, which means they are among the most active users
in digging. Second, the top 100 users all have good digging
power with digg success rate ranging from 0:24 to 0:45. By
contrast, the low ranking users are very divergent in digging
frequency and digging power: some users dugg infrequently

but with very high success rate; some others dugg as much
as some top users but with very low success rate. Over-
all, the top 100 users are more powerful because they not
only digg the most but also promote stories the most. Fur-
ther examination reveals that 76 of the top 100 users are
among top 0:1% (correspondingly 89 users are among top
0:5%) of the total users ranked by PageRank value in the
crawled graph. Because high-indegree users tend to have
high PageRank value and also they tend to digg more as
shown in Section 4.2, the high digging power of these top
100 users result from their high visibility to the commu-
nity. It is worth pointing out that 30:2% of the top 0:1%
users (ranked by PageRank value) did not digg in the trace.
This further renders the top 100 users (shown in the (cid:12)g-
ure) more in(cid:13)uential in story promotion.
Interviews with
Digg users [16] reveal that the top users might exploit their
digging power to game the system.
4.5 Content Filtering vs User Diggs

Digg users discover and browse content in three ways: (1)
using the front page to browse recently promoted stories; (2)
using the upcoming page to view recently submitted stories;
and (3) using the friends interface to see the stories her
friends have recently submitted or dugg. The front page and
the friends interface are essentially content (cid:12)lters, which sift
content by the story promotion algorithm and friends’ taste
respectively. Undoubtedly, content (cid:12)ltering in(cid:13)uences how
people view and rate content.

The (cid:12)rst question we raise is: Do friends’ diggs in(cid:13)uence
one’s votes? To answer the question, leveraging VSM [11]
in IR algorithms we introduce a concept of vote similarity
to quantify the in(cid:13)uence of friends. For a user u and her m
friends, let X and Y denote the user u’s and her friends’ digg
vector respectively. The digg vector X (or Y ) consists of m
(or n) (s; f (s)) pairs, where s is the story the user (or her
friends) dugg and f (s) is the number of diggs on the story
s by the user (or her friends4).

For each pair (si; f (si)) in a digg vector, we replace it
with (si; wi) by using the dampened scheme [23] where wi =
1 + logf (si). Considering digg vector X, we normalize it as
follows: For each (si; wi)2X, we normalize its weight wi and
substitute it with a normalized weight w0

i =

wi
qPm
j=1 wj

2 .

Following the above process, we get normalized digg vec-
tors X 0 and Y 0 for the user and her friends respectively.

4If k friends vote for s, then f (s) = k.

Vote similarity

Figure 14: The left (cid:12)gure plots CDF of vote simi-
larity across users in ST. The right (cid:12)gure plots av-
erage vote similarity across the users with the same
number of friends. \random" represents the corre-
sponding randomized graph.

Then, the vote similarity between the user u and her friends
is:

Sim(X 0; Y 0) = X

w0

X 0;i(cid:1)w0

Y 0;i

(1)

si 2X 0\Y 0

Where w0

X 0;i and w0

Y 0;i are the normalized weight of story
si in X 0 and Y 0 respectively. The vote similarity lies in be-
tween [0; 1]: A high value means that a user has dugg many
same stories with her friends; a low value indicates that the
user and her friends have dugg very few stories in common.
Note that the vote similarity exaggerates in(cid:13)uence of friends
because a user digging on a same story with her friends does
not necessary imply that the user follows her friends (e.g.,
a user dugg a same story with her friends in coincidence or
a user dugg a same story earlier than her friends did). It
represents the upper bound of friends’ in(cid:13)uence.

To better assess the in(cid:13)uence of the friends on one’s diggs,
we also compare the vote similarities obtained in Digg with
those computed in a corresponding randomized graph, one
with the same number of nodes and degree distribution but
with friend links randomly selected. Figure 14 shows vote
similarity of users with their friends in Digg and the ran-
domized graph respectively. Three main observations can be
made: (1) Compared to the randomized graph, Digg users’
diggs are indeed in(cid:13)uenced by their friends, especially those
with a small number of friends. We speculate that users
with fewer number of friends can more easily track their
friends’ diggs and thus get in(cid:13)uenced. (2) Most of (97:2%)
users have vote similarity of less than 0:4 with their friends
while a few (1:9%) users have vote similarity of more than
0:5 with their friends; (3) The vote similarity for users with
fewer number of friends ((cid:20) 200) is consistent while that for
users with higher number of friends is divergent. Further ex-
amination reveals that this is consistent with the correlation
of users’ diggs and their number of friends in Figure 8: The
number of diggs submitted by users with higher number of
friends spans a wide range, thus resulting in a wide range of
vote similarity. In summary, the friends interface indeed in-
(cid:13)uences users’ digging behavior, especially those with fewer
number of friends.

Next, we explore how the front page impacts users on
viewing and digging stories. In addition to collected diggs
in ST, we have also gathered the users’ comments on the
stories over the duration of ST, for better characterizing the
users’ activities on content viewing and rating. To quantify
the impact of promotion on popular stories, it is straightfor-
ward: For a popular story which is promoted at age of t, we
compare the visits (diggs and comments) received prior to

promotion and those received from age t to 2t. For upcom-
ing stories, we use t = 72 hours. This is because all popular
stories are promoted within 72 hours as mentioned in Sec-
tion 4.3. However, we do not claim that 72 hours are the
choice of the most appropriate. Table 2 shows impact of the
front page on content viewing and rating in terms of percent-
age increase. The front page placement signi(cid:12)cantly boosts
the number of votes and comments on the popular stories
by 4:6 (cid:0) 5:6 times; the upcoming stories, sifted out by the
promotion algorithm, rapidly lose 95% of user interactions.
We thus conclude that story promotion, as an information
(cid:12)ltering technique, signi(cid:12)cantly a(cid:11)ects how people browse
and rate information.

Figure 15 shows both digg and story distributions vs sub-
mission time distribution of the stories dugg by users from
2009=03=17 to 2009=04=16. The diggs on upcoming stories
represents diggs on stories (including prospective popular
stories prior to their promotion) while the diggs on popular
stories represents diggs on stories after their promotion. The
y-axis is in log-scale. Note that users dugg a small portion of
very old stories (even 5 years ago), including upcoming and
popular stories 5. For the old popular stories (due to limited
space in Digg’s front page) and the old upcoming stories,
they both are signi(cid:12)cantly less viewed and rated and thus
get (cid:12)ltered. We have conjectured that users dugg them up
via the friends interface. The small portion of the old stories
and their diggs, con(cid:12)rms in(cid:13)uence of the friends interface.
Story age adversely a(cid:11)ects diggs. For instance, recent stories
(submitted from 2009=03=17 to 2009=04=16) absorb 96:1%
of all users’ diggs. Moreover, it con(cid:12)rms that popular stories
draw signi(cid:12)cantly more votes than their counterparts thanks
to content (cid:12)ltering by the story promotion algorithm, con-
sidering that the number of popular stories is far less than
that of upcoming stories.
4.6 Summary

We end this section with a brief summary of our (cid:12)ndings:

(cid:15) Both traces show stable digging activities across Digg
users. An overwhelming majority of users digg stories

5Even the (cid:12)rst submitted story in 2004=12=01 was dugg by
the users.

infrequently while a small number of users are very
active (i.e., a couple hundred diggs per day). Exami-
nation of inter-digg time intervals and entropy distri-
bution of user digging behavior suggests existence of
digg spam.

(cid:15) Users with more visibility (i.e., more fans) have a ten-
dency to digg more. Users are also more active in
digging with increasing number of friends up to 200
friends; Beyond that, there is no strong correlation of
the number of friends and digging frequency.

(cid:15) The number of diggs and digg rate are among deter-
minants of story promotion. Evidence indicates that
Digg is censoring content.

(cid:15) Analysis of story promotion using PageRank indicates
that user diggs are not equally assessed. Users are not
equally powerful in digging stories. A few users with
high PageRank value have high digging power thanks
to their high visibility (i.e., high number of fans) to the
community. The in(cid:13)uential users could be the source
of system gaming.

(cid:15) Information (cid:12)ltering presented in Digg includes the
friends interface and the story promotion. The friends
interface in(cid:13)uences users on viewing and rating con-
tent, especially those with fewer number of friends.
The story promotion is substantially in(cid:13)uential to users.

Our (cid:12)ndings provide insights into design of the story pro-
motion algorithm. The algorithm can leverage the low link
symmetry in Digg to identify reputed source of diggs (as
search engines leverage the same property in the Web to
identify trusted Web pages), thus counteracting Sybil at-
tacks. Analysis of inter-digg time intervals and entropy of
diggs can help detect spammers, and thus makes story pro-
motion aware of digg spam. Moreover, the algorithm should
be resilient to gaming by the in(cid:13)uential users.

Our results have revealed that only those users with fewer
number of friends are in(cid:13)uenced by their friends on viewing
and rating content, and that most users and their friends
do not have many diggs in common. The limited space of
the front page and upcoming page in Digg does not meet all
users’s needs in discovering interesting content. One rem-
edy to content discovery is recommendation-assisted content
discovery. We can cluster system-wide users based on their
digg and submission activities 6 (e.g., by using bottom-up
hierarchical clustering), and like-minded voters are grouped
into same clusters. Users can go to a recommendation page
consisting of stories voted and submitted by their cluster
members to discover interesting content.

5. RELATED WORK

A large body of previous studies (e.g., [9, 17, 10, 20])
have examined graph theoretic properties of many online
social networks. While con(cid:12)rming some important (cid:12)ndings
in structural properties (e.g., power-law node indegree de-
gree distribution and clustering), our study reveals strikingly
di(cid:11)erent properties in Digg social network, such as a much
lower degree of link symmetry and weaker correlation of in-
degree and outdegree. Some other previous studies (e.g.,

6Submission of a story can be viewed as a vote on the story.

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA1047[13, 15, 14, 21]) have investigated usage patterns in social
networks. For example, Nazir et al. [21] highlighted that a
small fraction of users account for the majority of the ac-
tivity within each Facebook application. Our (cid:12)ndings also
show that a few Digg users are very active in digging stories
while an overwhelming majority of users vote infrequently.
We are not the (cid:12)rst to study Digg social network. Ler-
man et al. [19] revealed that stories spreading mainly outside
of the submitter’s neighborhood tend to become popular,
which is complementary to our work. While recent work [18]
showed that the friends interface in(cid:13)uences users digging
stories, our study quanti(cid:12)es the in(cid:13)uence of the friends in-
terface by measuring vote similarity between users and their
friends. Our (cid:12)ndings indicate that users with fewer number
of friends tend to be in(cid:13)uenced by their friends and that
story promotion, as content (cid:12)ltering, signi(cid:12)cantly impacts
users digging stories.

Vote spam and Sybil attacks have raised concerns on con-
tent rating. For example, Tran et al. [24] presented adaptive
vote (cid:13)ow aggregation to limit the number of bogus votes
cast by attackers, and Bian et al. [12] proposed a machine
learning-based framework for social media to counteract vote
spam. Our work provides evidence of vote spam in Digg so-
cial network, and further proposes exploiting low link sym-
metry (e.g., PageRank) to identify trusted voters in Digg to
counter such attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the (cid:12)rst to
extensively (by using over 52 months worth of digg trace
data) study user voting activities on content, and impact of
the social network on content rating and vice versa. Our
work has also investigated the issues of content promotion,
content (cid:12)ltering, vote spam and content censorship, which
are inherent to content rating networks.
6. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have investigated the structural properties
and digging activities of Digg, an online content voting net-
work. Our data shows that the Digg social network di(cid:11)ers
from many other online social networks in that it has a low
level link symmetry, the node outdegree distribution does
not have a pow-law tail, it exhibits weak correlation of inde-
gree and outdegree, and nodes tend to connect to nodes with
di(cid:11)erent degree from their own. By analyzing the correla-
tion of users’ social links and their diggs, we show that: (1)
Users digg more with increasing number of fans; (2) Users
digg more as the number of friends increases until reach-
ing 200 friends. Beyond that, there is no strong correlation
of the number of friend links and diggs. Besides showing
that the number of diggs and digg rate are in(cid:13)uential to
story promotion, we present evidence of content censorship
in story promotion. Our results highlight that those users
with high visibility are more in(cid:13)uential to story promotion.
We have studied impact of content (cid:12)ltering including the
friends interface and story promotion on users viewing and
digging stories. The examination of inter-digg time intervals
and entropy distribution of user diggs indicates presence of
spammers. We have outlined how these (cid:12)ndings may af-
fect the story promotion algorithm and content discovery
for online content social networks. In our next step, we plan
to investigate the properties of the activity network con-
structed based on user interactions: a directional edge from
A to B is formed if user A dugg or wrote a comment on B’s

stories; and the edge weight is proportional to the number
of diggs and comments A generated for B’s stories. The ac-
tivity network may lend insight into the actual dynamics of
interaction between users in online content rating networks.
