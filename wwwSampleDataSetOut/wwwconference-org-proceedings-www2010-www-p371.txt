ABSTRACT
When online ads are shown together, they compete for user
attention and conversions, imposing negative externalities
on each other. While the competition for user attention
in sponsored search can be captured via models of click-
through rates, the post-click competition for conversions
cannot: since the value-per-click of an advertiser is propor-
tional to the conversion probability conditional on a click,
which depends on the other ads displayed, the private value
of an advertiser is no longer one-dimensional, and the GSP
mechanism is not adequately expressive. We study the de-
sign of expressive GSP-like mechanisms for the simplest form
that an advertiser’s private value can have in the presence
of such externalities— an advertiser’s value depends on ex-
clusivity, i.e., whether her ad is shown exclusively, or along
with other ads.

Our auctions take as input two-dimensional (per-click)
bids for exclusive and nonexclusive display, and have two
types of outcomes: either a single ad is displayed exclusively,
or multiple ads are simultaneously shown. We design two
expressive auctions that are both extensions of GSP— the
ﬁrst auction, GSP2D, is designed with the property that the
allocation and pricing are identical to GSP when multiple
ads are shown; the second auction, N P2D, is designed to be a
next price auction. We show that both auctions have high ef-
ﬁciency and revenue in all reasonable equilibria; further, the
N P2D auction is guaranteed to always have an equilibrium
with revenue at least as much as the current GSP mecha-
nism. However, we ﬁnd that unlike with one-dimensional
valuations, the GSP-like auctions for these richer valuations
do not always preserve eﬃciency and revenue with respect
to the VCG mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

shown alongside

Online advertisements

each other
compete—ﬁrst, for the user’s attention, and then for a con-
version. The eﬀectiveness of an ad, therefore, depends not
only on targeting it accurately to a relevant user, but also on
the set of other advertisements that are displayed along with
it: when an ad for a product is shown along with other high-
quality competing ads, the chance that a user will purchase
from the ﬁrst advertiser is diminished. Online ads that are
shown together thus impose negative externalities on each
other.

This externality eﬀect comes from two factors. First, the
presence of other advertisements decreases the amount of
attention an ad gets from a user: the user may not notice or
click on an ad because of other competing ads. Second, even
if a user notices or clicks on an ad, he may not convert on it,
but instead convert on a competing advertisement. Indeed,
a user looking to purchase a product would arguably click on
multiple ads before deciding which one to convert on. Such
ads, which have already successfully competed for attention,
now compete with each other for a conversion from the user.
This externality eﬀect from post-click competition for con-
versions cannot be captured by models of clickthrough rates,
which only model the eﬀect of other ads on user attention;
rather, as we argue below, they aﬀect advertisers’ private
values per-click. In this paper, we will focus on the eﬀect
of externalities on conversions, and the design of adequately
expressive auctions for such externalities.

In sponsored search auctions, where advertisers bid per
click but ultimately derive value from conversions, the pres-
ence of externalities aﬀects the private value. An advertiser’s
value-per-click is the product of her value-per-conversion
times the probability of a conversion conditional on a click,
i.e., vclick = vconv · P r(conv|click).
If P r(conv|click) de-
pends on whether or not other ads are simultaneously dis-
played, the advertiser’s (private) value-per-click will be dif-
ferent as well — that is, the private per-click-value is no
longer one-dimensional. In such a situation, a mechanism
such as the existing GSP mechanism1, which solicits only
a one-dimensional bid and always displays a full slate of
ads, can be arbitrarily ineﬃcient2. To achieve eﬃciency,

mechanism must be adequately expressive.

In general, an advertiser’s valuation in an auction with
n bidders and externalities can be a function v : 2n → R,
which is exponential in the number of bidders3. Allowing
very general valuations, even with restrictions on the model
to ensure reasonably-sized reports, has two problems. First,
reporting high-dimensional valuations imposes a heavy cog-
nitive burden on advertisers (particularly the less sophisti-
cated ones), who may not be able to determine their values
for a wide range of outcomes [17, 19], making such a bid-
ding language highly impractical. Second, in general, set-
based valuations can lead to computational hardness and
inapproximability in the winner determination problem, by
reduction from independent set4.

We will adopt a very simple valuation model for external-
ities, based on exclusivity: an advertiser’s value depends on
whether or not other ads are shown along with her ad, i.e.,
whether she is shown exclusively or not. Such a valuation
model is very reasonable in the context of online advertising:
ﬁrst, only one additional bid is solicited from advertisers, in
addition to the bid they already place in the existing GSP
auction. Second, given that bidding languages that involve
competitor identities can lead to computational hardness, a
natural, expressive bidding language is one that speciﬁes a
value for each possible number of other ads displayed along-
with —i.e., if k is the number of slots, this valuation would
be represented by a (decreasing) k-dimensional vector. Our
two-dimensional valuation is a simple approximation, espe-
cially from an advertiser’s point of view, for such a vector.
Also, the two-dimensional language based on exclusivity can
arguably better represent5 valuations where the identity of
competitors actually inﬂuences value, such as for keywords
where some competing ads cause much greater decrease in
value than others.

We will be interested in designing expressive GSP-like
mechanisms for this setting with two-dimensional private
values (i.e., with and without exclusivity). By GSP-like
auctions, we mean auctions that are extensions, in ways we
will make precise, of the generalized second price auction
(GSP) currently used to sell sponsored search ads. Such

and ǫ if any other ads are shown along with. Since GSP does
not have an outcome which displays a single ad, advertisers
simply bid according to their value of ǫ, resulting in an ef-
ﬁciency of most nǫ compared to the optimal eﬃciency of 1
(display a single ad).
3In fact, the domain of v can be even larger if a bidder’s
value depends not just on the set of all winners, but also on
the exact allocation, such as the precise ordering of other
advertisers in slots in sponsored search.
4Each node corresponds to an advertiser who derives value
0 , if any of her neighbors are included in the set of winners,
and 1 otherwise. Choosing the optimal set of advertisers to
display corresponds exactly to ﬁnding the largest indepen-
dent set in the graph.
5It is likely that when advertiser is displayed along with a
full slate of other ads, the competitors that cause the great-
est decrease in value to her are included as well, causing
the maximum decrease in value; in contrast, when only one
other ad is displayed along with, the value obtained would
depend on whether that ad is a strong competitor (minimum
value) or not (maximum value). So an advertiser can simply
use his highest and lowest valuations in the exclusivity-based
language, but deriving his value vector when some competi-
tors aﬀect value more than others is much harder for the
k-dimensional bidding language.

auctions have two major advantages over auctions that de-
viate signiﬁcantly from GSP (such as the VCG auction):
ﬁrst, advertisers face a smooth transition between the exist-
ing and new system, and do not ﬁnd themselves faced with
an unfamiliar and complex auction; second, they are also are
easier to build and integrate with the existing system. Auc-
tions which are extensions of GSP are therefore far more
likely to actually be deployed in practice. Other research
on designing auctions for sponsored search with more com-
plex valuations has focused on extending the GSP auction
as well ([2, 16]), reﬂecting the practicality of designing such
GSP-like auctions.

Results and Organization. We design two expressive
auctions that are both extensions of the GSP auction, and
analyze their equilibria for revenue and eﬃciency. Both auc-
tions take as input two-dimensional (per-click) bids (b, b′) for
exclusive and nonexclusive display, and have two types of
outcomes: S, where a single ad is displayed, and M, where
a full slate of multiple ads is shown. Since both auctions
are not truthful and can have multiple equilibria, we com-
pare the equilibria of each auction to V CG2D, the VCG
auction for two-dimensional valuations (we also provide ad-
ditive bounds or pointwise comparisons of equilibria of the
two auctions where possible).

There are two natural ways to extend the GSP auction
to this two-dimensional setting. The ﬁrst is to require that
when multiple ads are displayed, the outcome should exactly
match GSP. Our ﬁrst auction, GSP2D, has the property that
when the outcome is M, the allocation and pricing is exactly
as if the bids b′ had been submitted to the original GSP auc-
tion (it then remains to design the rule deciding whether the
outcome will be S or M, and the pricing for S, to ensure good
equilibrium properties). The second is to extend the ‘next-
price’ principle of GSP to the two-dimensional setting: our
second auction, N P2D has the property that every winner
pays the minimum amount necessary to keep his position
(note that GSP2D is not a next price auction: in the two-
dimensional setting, maintaining one’s position in outcome
M involves both maintaining the outcome type (M versus
S), and maintaining one’s ranking amongst the winners in
M).

The comparison between the two auctions is rather subtle.
N P2D has better eﬃciency guarantees than GSP2D when
the eﬃcient outcome is M, while GSP2D is, roughly speak-
ing, slightly better when the eﬃcient outcome is S. In all
cases, the welfare in all ‘good’ equilibria where losers bid at
least their true value is guaranteed to be at least half the op-
timal eﬃciency (we show that such good equilibria always
exist for both auctions).
In terms of revenue, N P2D has
better revenue guarantees when the equilibrium outcome is
S, dominating the V CG2D revenue, while GSP2D is guar-
anteed to have at least half the V CG2D revenue. When
the equilibrium outcome is M, all envy-free equilibria of
GSP2D dominate the V CG2D revenue, whereas there is no
corresponding multiplicative bound for N P2D. However, all
envy-free equilibria of N P2D revenue-dominate V CGM , the
revenue from the one-dimensional VCG mechanism; also, all
the high-revenue M-equilibria of GSP2D are M-equilibria of
N P2D as well. Further, unlike GSP2D, the N P2D auction is
guaranteed to always have an equilibrium with revenue at
least as much as the current GSP mechanism.

Related Work. There is a rapidly growing literature on
externalities in online advertising, starting with the work in

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA372[9] which addresses the conversion aspect, but does not di-
rectly apply to sponsored search. Externalities in sponsored
search are studied theoretically by [3], [15], [11] and [21],
and empirically by [12, 14]. However, all of these focus on
the eﬀect of externalities on the clickthrough rate, that is,
the attention aspect. The work in [7] does address the con-
version aspect; however, it assumes a speciﬁc form for the
conversion rates and more importantly, focuses on analyz-
ing equilibria for this model of conversion rates under the
existing GSP mechanism. In contrast, we focus on design-
ing mechanisms with a more expressive bidding language
and outcome space.

In simultaneous and independent work, [16] proposes the
agenda of designing auctions where advertisers bid for con-
ﬁgurations; our work provides a thorough design and analy-
sis for one type of conﬁguration, namely exclusivity (see §5
for a more detailed discussion on the relation between the
two problems).

[18] studies auctions with share-averse bidders, i.e., bid-
ders suﬀering from negative externalities when an item is
shared amongst multiple competitors, exactly as in on-
line advertising. However,
[18] focuses on characterizing
the revenue-maximizing single item auction for this setting,
whereas we want to design GSP-like auctions for sponsored
search. Finally, a primary motivation for our work is the loss
in eﬃciency due to limited expressiveness. The work in [5]
provides a general theory for expressiveness in mechanisms,
and relates the eﬃciency of mechanisms to their expressive-
ness in a domain independent manner.

2. MODEL

There are n advertisers bidding for a page with k slots.
Advertiser i’s private value is the two-tuple (vi, v′
i), where
vi is her value-per-click for being displayed exclusively, i.e.,
with no other ads on the page, and v′
i is her value-per-click
if other ads are shown as well. We make the natural as-
sumption that each advertiser (weakly) prefers exclusivity,
i.e., vi ≥ v′
i.

There are two types of outcomes: S, where only a single
ad is displayed on the page, and M, where multiple ads are
displayed. (Note that the maximum possible number of ads
are always displayed in M, since bidders do not have, or ex-
press, higher values for displaying i ads, 1 < i < k.) We
denote the clickthrough rate (CTR) of the i-th slot in out-
come M by θi, and assume, without loss of generality, that
the CTR of the only slot in outcome S is 1. It is natural to
expect that the CTR with outcome S is at least as large as
than that of any slot in M, i.e., 1 ≥ θ1 ≥ . . . ≥ θk. We also
deﬁne θi = 0 for i > k for convenience. (We point out that
our results also extend to the case of separable clickthrough
rates, where the CTR of an ad in a slot is a product of an
ad-dependent clickability and a slot-dependent clickability;
we use the simpler model for clarity of exposition.)

will use the indices max and max2 to denote the bidders

for every i, and vmax2 ≥ vi for every i 6= max. We will
also abuse notation to use bmax and bmax2 to denote the
highest and second highest S-bids, respectively (in all equi-
libria of interest, these will actually correspond to the same
bidders as with the true S-values). Furthermore, we deﬁne
vmax−i and bmax−i to be the advertisers who have highest
S-value and highest S-bid excluding advertiser i. In other
words, vmax−i = vmax and bmax−i = bmax if i 6= max, and
vmax−i = vmax2 and bmax−i = bmax2 if i = max. Finally,

A mechanism for this setting decides on the winning con-
ﬁguration, i.e., whether the outcome is S or M, and the
winning advertisers (and their ranking if the outcome is M),
and the prices for the winners. The VCG mechanism, of
course, applies to this setting, and is a truthful mechanism
which always produces an eﬃcient (i.e., welfare maximizing)
outcome.

We use V CG2D to denote the VCG mechanism applied
to our setting where bidder values are two-dimensional, and
V CGM to denote VCG for the one-dimensional setting stud-
ied in [20, 8], where the only possible outcome is M and
advertisers have one-dimensional valuations. We make this
distinction to easily distinguish between the VCG revenues
in the various settings.

Restricting Equilibria. We will be interested only in
equilibria where losers bid at least their true value, which
we will refer to as “good” equilibria. This is particularly
relevant when the outcome is S: while there might be Nash
equilibria where the losing bidders must bid b′
i to ensure

i < v′

essential to the proofs.

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA373that the winner has no incentive to deviate to outcome M, it
is unreasonable to expect that the losing bidders will not bid
higher in an eﬀort to change the outcome to M, which would
give them positive utility. Thus, Nash equilibria where the
outcome is S but losers bid less than their true values simply
to maintain equilibrium are unlikely to exist in practice.

since the eﬃciency and revenue guarantees for GSPM rela-
tive to V CG1D themselves hold only for envy-free equilibria
of GSPM .)

The easy lemma below, which follows immediately from
individual rationality, will be used repeatedly in the follow-
ing two subsections.

3. GSP2D

In this section, we design an auction with the following
property: given a set of bids (bi, b′
i), suppose the auction
decides to display multiple ads, i.e., the outcome is M. Then,
the allocation and pricing for the winning ads is exactly
the same as when GSPM is applied to the bids b′
i. This
requirement ensures the practical beneﬁt that when multiple
ads are displayed, advertisers see no diﬀerence at all between
the new auction and the existing system.

Given that the allocation pricing for outcome M is com-
pletely speciﬁed, it remains to design the rule that decides
whether the outcome will be S or M, as well as the pricing
for S. The GSP2D auction is deﬁned below.

does not quite work: if the bidder with the highest M-value
is diﬀerent from the bidder max with the highest S-value,
that bidder will always set b′

outcome to M at no cost to her (as long as there is some
other non-zero bid b′
i), since the pricing when the outcome
is M according to GSP remains b′
2. That is, using the
natural allocation rule would imply that the only possible
equilibria are those with outcome M, defeating the purpose
of designing a more expressive auction.

In the remainder of this section, we will investigate the
eﬃciency and revenue of the equilibria of this mechanism.
The restriction to using GSPM when the outcome is M does
cause a potential loss in eﬃciency and revenue with respect
to V CG2D, unlike the case with one-dimensional valuations
where all envy free equilibria of GSPM are eﬃcient and dom-
inate V CGM in terms of revenue. However, as we show be-
low, GSP2D has fairly nice properties nonetheless: both the
eﬃciency and revenue of all reasonable equilibria of GSP2D
are guaranteed to be at least within a factor 1/3 and 1/2 re-
spectively of the optimal eﬃciency and revenue. (By reason-
able equilibria, we mean equilibria of the mechanism where
losers bid at least their true value; we show such equilib-
ria always exist. Further, when the outcome is M, we will
restrict ourselves, as in [20] and [8], to envy free equilibria,

3.1 Efﬁciency

We consider two cases, one where the eﬃcient outcome
is S, and the other where the eﬃcient outcome is M, and
analyze the eﬃciency of the equilibria of GSP2D. Note that
we prove our eﬃciency results for all reasonable equilibria,
rather than only showing that there exists one equilibrium
with these properties.

Due to want of space, the proofs of the following results
are omitted, and can be found in the full version of the paper
[10].

Every equilibrium of GSP2D with outcome S where losers

eﬃcient.

In this section, we compare the revenues of equilibria in

GSP2D with the revenue of V CG2D.

Proof. First, recall that by Theorem 3.1, the only possi-
ble equilibrium outcome is S, so that the revenue of GSP2D

terms and then show that the revenue of V CG2D cannot be
larger than the sum of the lower bounds; therefore, the rev-
enue of V CG2D cannot be more than twice of the revenue
of GSP2D.

Proof. First, note that since the equilibrium is envy-
free, the ordering of M-bids is the same as ordering of M-
values ([20]), i.e., v′

the payment of advertiser i (for i ≤ k) in GSP2D is at least
as much as his payment in V CG2D.

The analysis of the other case is almost identical to
when max ∈ {[2], . . . , [k]}, so we omit repeating it here.

Example 3.1 shows that this factor 2 is tight as well.

How does GSP2D compare to GSPM in terms of rev-
enue? Suppose bidders have two-dimensional valuations
(vi, v′
i), but are only oﬀered the GSPM mechanism with
its one-dimensional bidding language. Since the outcome of
GSPM is never S, bidders will bid according to valuations
v′
i in GSPM . The example below shows that the revenue of
GSP2D (in every equilibrium) can actually be smaller than
the revenue in GSPM , i.e., if the search engine had persisted
with the old mechanism. However, the mechanism we de-
sign in the next section does not suﬀer from this potential
loss in revenue with respect to GSPM .

Example 3.1. Suppose there are two slots with θ1 = θ2 =
1 − ǫ, and three bidders with values v1 = 1 + ǫ, v2 = v3 = 1,
and v′
i = 1 for i ≤ 3. The revenue of GSPM for this example
is 2 − 2ǫ for all equilibria, and the utility is 0 for all bidders.
However, if advertiser 1 bids (∞, 0), and advertisers 2 and
3 bid truthfully, this is an equilibrium with revenue 1 − ǫ and
payment 1−ǫ with utility 2ǫ > 0 for the winner. In fact, this
is the highest possible revenue in any equilibrium outcome of
GSP2D.

Finally, we conclude with showing that good equilibria
(where losers bid their true values) always exist, so that the
theorems we proved so far are not vacuous.

ˆv′
i be the i-th highest M-value excluding v′

is the bidder who has the highest S-value. (In the eﬃcient

vmax2 > S1 so the outcome will always be S irrespective of
max’s bid; so there is no deviation for max that changes the
outcome to M. Therefore, every bidder except max bidding
truthfully and max bidding (∞, 0) is a good equilibrium of
GSP2D with outcome S. So, for the rest of the proof, we
assume j ≥ 1, and hence t exists.

If uM ≥ uS, everyone except max bidding truthfully and
max bidding (St − 2ǫ, ˆv′
t−1 − ǫ) is an equilibrium of GSP2D
with outcome M. The outcome is M by deﬁnition of St,
and also because St ≥ vmax2 . Consider a bidder a 6= max.
If bidder a decreases her M-bid, the outcome switches to
S leading to utility 0 for her. Furthermore, since a is bid-
ding her true M-value, any overstating value which results
in change of allocation leads to negative utility for a; there-
fore, a has no proﬁtable deviation. We know that bidder
max is already getting the slot which has maximum utility
for her among slots 1, . . . , j, and there is no deviation for
her leading to outcome M with slot lower than j. Therefore,
any deviation which leads to outcome M is not proﬁtable for
max. Also, since uS < uM , we know that max prefers out-
come M to S, and hence, any deviation which switches the
outcome to S can not be proﬁtable. Next, consider the case
where uM < uS. In this case, all bidders except max bidding
truthfully and max bidding (∞, 0) is a good equilibrium of
GSP2D with outcome S. No loser can change the outcome
to M proﬁtably, and max prefers the current outcome to any
M-outcome.

4. NP2D: A NEXT PRICE AUCTION

The current GSP auction, GSPM ,

is a next price
auction—every winner pays the ”next price”, i.e., the mini-
mum bid necessary in order to maintain her position, which
in GSPM is the bid of the next highest bidder. In our two-
dimensional setting, where there are two types of outcomes
in addition to multiple slots, maintaining one’s position con-
sists of two things for a winner in outcome M: ﬁrst, the out-
come must remain M and not switch to S; second, the bid
must enable the bidder to maintain her position amongst the
k slots. In a next price auction for our more expressive set-
ting, therefore, the payment of a winner in slot i of outcome
M is the larger of two terms— the ﬁrst being the minimum
value at which the outcome still remains M, and the second
being the bid of the next bidder, b′
i+1, as in GSPM . The
auction is formally deﬁned below.

Note that in computing the price for outcome S, the second
term is smaller than Γ.

In the next two subsections, we will analyze the eﬃciency
and revenue respectively in the equilibria of N P2D. As be-
fore, we will prove guarantees for the revenue and eﬃciency
of good equilibria, where losers bid at least their true value
(such equilibria always exist, as we show in Proposition 4.1).
Some proofs have been removed for want of space, and can
be found in the full version of the paper [10].
4.1 Efﬁciency

As before, we consider two cases corresponding to the eﬃ-
cient outcome being S or M. We ﬁrst start with the following
lemma, which allows us to prove the eﬃciency result for S.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that bidder max is bidding truth-
fully.
If the outcome of N P2D for a given vector of bids
is S, then the winner max cannot beneﬁt from any deviation
that changes the outcome to M.

Proof. Assume max = j, i.e., the bidder max has the
jth largest M-bid for the given M-bids b′
i from the remaining
bidders. By assumption that max bids truthfully, b′
j = v′
j
and bmax = vmax. We need to show that bidder max = j
prefers outcome S to any position in outcome M. Consider
an M-bid b
l−1, i.e., targeting
slot l, and assume the deviation changes the outcome to M.
j−1, outcome M gives bidder
j negative utility because her payment would be at least
j−1 > b′
b′
j in this case. So without loss of generality we may

Theorem 4.2. Suppose the eﬃcient outcome is M. Then
the eﬃciency in any good equilibrium of N P2D with outcome
S is at least 1/2 of the optimal eﬃciency.

Then the welfare in any good equilibrium of N P2D with out-

is the optimal welfare and j is the rank of M-value of bidder
max, i.e. max = [j].

come S is at least OP T −Pk

i=j θi(v′

[i] − v′

Note that if the marketplace is competitive, i.e., the v′
i’s are
not very diﬀerent, the additive bound shows that the loss
in welfare will be small even when the ineﬃcient outcome
occurs.

Finally, suppose the eﬃcient outcome is M and the equi-
librium outcome is M as well. A result similar to that [8,
20] stating that all envy free equilibria are eﬃcient holds
for N P2D as well. However, before we state the result, we
need to extend the notion of envy free equilibria to N P2D;
we will then prove, via Lemma 4.2, that the set of envy-free
equilibria are all eﬃcient.

The notion of envy free equilibria in [8] can be thought of
as restricting the set of bid vectors that are Nash equilibria
to those that also generate envy free prices [13], i.e., a price
for each slot such that no bidder envies the allocation of an-
other bidder at this price. We use exactly this idea to deﬁne
envy free equilibria for outcome M in the N P2D auction: A
vector of bids leading to outcome M in N P2D is an envy free
equilibrium if for any i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n)

θi(v′

i − pi) ≥ θj (v′

i − pj)

where pi and pj are the prices bidders i and j are currently
paying for slots i and j respectively. (Recall that θi = 0 for
i > k.)

Lemma 4.2. If v′

b for bidders a and b, and θp > θq
for slots p and q, then any allocation A that assigns bidder
a to slot q and bidder b to slot p is not envy-free.

a > v′

Proof. Assume for sake of contradiction that A is envy-
free and suppose that the prices for slots p and q are pp
and pq respectively. For A being envy-free we must have
θp(v′
b − pq).
Subtracting the second inequality from the ﬁrst one we get
θp(v′
b), but this last inequality contradicts
v′
a > v′

a − pq) and θp(v′

b − pp) ≥ θq(v′

a − pp) ≤ θq(v′

b and θq < θp.

b) ≤ θq(v′

a − v′

a − v′

This allows for an easy proof of the following result:

such that the eﬃcient outcome is S, i.e., vmax >Pk

Theorem 4.1. Suppose the underlying valuations are
[i].
There exists an equilibrium with outcome S where losers bid
at least their true values. Further, there is no ineﬃcient
equilibrium where all bidders play undominated strategies.

i=1 θiv′

Unlike in GSP2D, ineﬃcient equilibria with outcome M
(with arbitrarily large ineﬃciency) can occur in N P2D when
the eﬃcient outcome is S. However, all such equilibria are
’bullying’ equilibria (such equilibria occur in GSPM as well)
where some bidder bids above her true value, which (Lemma
7.1 in the full version of the paper) is a weakly dominated
strategy in N P2D.

Next, suppose the eﬃcient outcome is M. Here, similar
to GSP2D, ineﬃciency can occur in N P2D as well; however,
the extent of ineﬃciency is less than that in GSP2D, as the
following multiplicative and additive bounds show.

The theorem below follows immediately from this lemma,
since it implies that in any envy-free allocation (not neces-
sarily even an equilibrium) of N P2D with outcome M, the
bidders must be allocated to the slots in decreasing order of
their M-values.

Theorem 4.3. Suppose the eﬃcient outcome is M. Then
any envy free equilibrium of N P2D with outcome M is eﬃ-
cient.
4.2 Revenue

When the equilibrium outcome in N P2D is S, the revenue

is high, in the following sense:

Theorem 4.4. Any good equilibrium of N P2D with out-

come S has at least the same revenue as V CG2D.

Note that here N P2D does better than GSP2D: the rev-
enue of GSP2D can be as small as half the V CG2D revenue

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA378when the equilibrium outcome is S and the eﬃcient out-
come is either S or M (Theorems 3.2 and 3.4). However,
while N P2D leads to better revenue guarantees when the
outcome is S, the same is not true for M: unlike GSP2D,
where every envy free equilibrium with outcome M revenue-
dominates V CG2D, the revenue in an envy free equilibrium
of N P2D can be arbitrarily smaller than that of V CG2D, as
the following example shows.

1) = (3, 3) and (v2, v′

Example 4.1. Suppose that there are two slots with θ1 =
1 and θ2 = 1 − ǫ/3. There are two bidders with values
(v1, v′
2) = (4, 2). The eﬃcient outcome
is M. If the bidders bid (b1, b′
2) = (2ǫ, ǫ),
the outcome is M; it is an envy-free equilibrium; and the rev-
enue is ǫ. However, revenue of V CG2D on this example is
2.

1) = (3, 3) and (b2, b′

That is, we cannot obtain a result similar to the previous
revenue results bounding the revenue loss with respect to
V CG2D by a multiplicative constant.

However, as the next three theorems will show, the situ-
ation is not quite as bleak as the previous example might
suggest: ﬁrst, Theorem 4.5 shows that the revenue of N P2D
in any envy-free equilibrium with outcome M is at least the
V CGM revenue. Second, and more importantly, Proposi-
tion 4.1 shows that there always exists an equilibrium of
N P2D with this revenue— note that this is not the case
with GSP2D, where there exist values such that every equi-
librium of GSP2D has revenue strictly less than the revenue
of V CGM (Example 3.1). The revenue comparison with
V CGM is important for the following reason— the V CGM
revenue can be thought of as a proxy for the GSPM rev-
enue, since there always exists an equilibrium of GSPM with
this revenue [8], and further, this is a “likely” equilibrium in
the sense that if bidders update their bids according to rea-
sonable greedy bidding strategies, the bids converge to this
equilibrium of GSPM [6]. Therefore, unlike GSP2D, there al-
ways exists an equilibrium of N P2D with revenue at least as
much as in GSPM , i.e., the transition to the richer outcome
space does not lead to revenue loss.

Finally, Theorem 4.6 shows that the N P2D auction also
retains all the high revenue equilibria with outcome M of
GSP2D: the reason for the nonexistence of a multiplicative
bound with respect to V CG2D is simply that N P2D has a
larger set of equilibria, some of which have poor revenue;
however, no high revenue M-equilibria of GSP2D are lost in
using the N P2D auction.

Theorem 4.5. Every envy-free outcome (not necessarily
an equilibrium) of N P2D with outcome M has revenue at
least as much as V CGM .

We point out that the proof of this result is independent
of how payments pi are calculated. In fact, any allocation
and pricing (even not restricted to our two-dimensional set-
ting) which is envy-free and eﬃcient satisﬁes the conditions
needed for the above proof, and hence has revenue at least
as much as V CGM .

Proposition 4.1. There always exists a good equilibrium
of N P2D with revenue greater than or equal to that of
V CGM .

The revenue of the equilibria constructed in Proposi-
[i+1]. Therefore, assum-
ing bidders do not play weakly dominated strategies in

tion 4.1 are at least Pk

i=1 θiv′

GSPM (speciﬁcally, bidders do not overstate their values),
no equilibrium of GSPM can have revenue higher than the
equilibrium of N P2D constructed in Proposition 4.1.

Finally, we show that N P2D retains all the high revenue

M-equilibria of GSP2D.

Theorem 4.6. Every equilibrium of GSP2D with out-
come M is an equilibrium with outcome M of N P2D with
equal revenue.

That is, while there is no multiplicative bound on the rev-
enue of an envy-free equilibrium of N P2D with outcome M,
all the high revenue M-equilibria of GSP2D, which dominate
the V CG2D revenue, are also equilibria of N P2D.
4.2.1 Revenue Non-monotonicity
We point out an interesting property of the N P2D auc-
tion: when bids go up, the revenue can actually decrease.
The following example illustrates this non-monotonicity in
revenue as a function of the bids:

Example 4.2. Suppose there are two slots with θ1 = θ2 =
1 and three bidders with bids (10, 0), (9, 9) and (2, 2). The
outcome is M, and the prices for bidders 2 and 3 are 8 and 1
respectively, so the revenue is 9. However, if the third bidder
increases her bid to (3, 3), the outcome remains M, but the
payments change to 7 and 1 for bidder 2 and 3 respectively.
Therefore, the revenue decreases to 8.

When the bids are such that bmax = P θib′
enue is exactly P θib′

i, the total rev-
i irrespective of which outcome is cho-
sen. If the tie is broken in favor of outcome M, every bidder
must pay exactly his bid, since for any bid below this the
outcome will switch to S. Now suppose all bidders bid b′
i + ǫ
(and don’t change their S- bids). The outcome remains M,
but every bidders payment decreases, since the minimum
amount needed to maintain outcome M given the other bids
has decreased. So the revenue decreases even though the
bids increase.

Note that this revenue non-monotonicity occurs in the
VCG auction as well, for the same reason. However, GSP2D
does not have this property in the sense that when the bids
increase the total revenue cannot decrease. Revenue mono-
tonicity is often considered a desirable property in practice,
and could inﬂuence the choice between which of the two
auctions, GSP2D or N P2D is actually used in practice.

5. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we designed two expressive GSP-like auc-
tions for exclusivity-based valuations, and showed that they
have good revenue and eﬃciency properties in equilib-
ria. While the N P2D auction has, roughly speaking, bet-
ter worst-case eﬃciency properties, and does better than
GSP2D in several cases in terms of revenue, it does have
envy-free equilibria with poor revenues, and shares VCG’s
revenue non-monotonicity problem. Choosing between the
two auctions will require an empirical assessment of the mar-
ketplace parameters as well as an understanding of bidder
valuations and behavior, to predict which equilibria are ac-
tually likely to arise in practice. (Note, as an aside, that
there is no way to infer S-values from the current GSPM
auction, since multiple ads are always shown.)

There are many directions for further work. The ﬁrst ob-
vious direction is to combine the more expressive bidding

WWW 2010 • Full PaperApril 26-30 • Raleigh • NC • USA379language with more complex cascade-like models for CTRs,
and analyze a model that incorporates both attention and
conversion based externalities. Second, the bidding language
we use can be thought of as a way to succinctly represent
a general decreasing k-dimensional vector valuation, where
an advertiser speciﬁes the ﬁrst entry in the vector (vi), and
uses v′
i as a proxy for all the remaining k − 1 entries. An al-
ternative language (also discussed in [16]) which also solicits
only two bids from an advertiser, is one where an advertiser
speciﬁes that he has value vi provided no more than ni ad-
vertisers are shown in all (and zero if any more are shown).
Which of these is a better representation of actual adver-
tiser valuations, and which is it possible to design better
mechanisms for? In general, the question of designing suc-
cinct mechanisms that achieve high eﬃciency in the presence
of underlying high-dimensional valuations is an interesting
open question.

While the auctions we design have pleasant properties
with respect to revenue and eﬃciency in their equilibria,
the comparison of these GSP-like auctions to VCG does
not remain quite as starkly positive as in the original one-
dimensional setting. Speciﬁcally, unlike [8, 20], where all
envy-free equilibria of GSPM are eﬃcient and have at least
the revenue of V CGM , both the N P2D and GSP2D auctions
suﬀer from losses in eﬃciency and revenue with respect to
V CG2D: neither auction need always have an eﬃcient equi-
librium, or one that guarantees at least as much revenue as
V CG2D. In fact, other research [1, 4] suggests as well that
the GSPM auction does not always have desirable properties
under more complex valuation models or more sophisticated
models of bidder behavior. Our results suggest that while
GSP turns out to have excellent properties for the simplest
model of advertiser valuations, this is very possibly no more
than a fortunate coincidence that does not extend to more
complex valuations. Thus, rather than continuing to build
on the GSP auction, it might be necessary to approach the
design of more expressive auctions for advertising on the
Internet from a clean slate.
