Games, Algorithms, and the Internet 

Prof Christos H. Papadimitriou 

 

 

 
Abstract 
The  advent  of  the  Internet  brought  parallel  paradigm  shifts  to  both  Economics  and 
Computer Science. Computer scientists realized that large-scale performing systems can 
emerge from the interaction of selfish agents and that incentives are a quintessential part 
of  a  good  system  design.   And  economists  saw  that  the default  platforms  of  economic 
transactions  are  computational  and  interconnected.   Algorithmic  Game  Theory  is  a  
subdiscipline  that  emerged  from  this  turmoil,  revisiting  some  of  the  most  important 
problems  in  Economics  and  Game  Theory  from  a  computational  and  network 
perspective. This talk will survey some of the major themes, results and challenges in this 
field.
