ABSTRACT
Social networking services are a fast-growing business in the
Internet. However, it is unknown if online relationships and
their growth patterns are the same as in real-life social net-
works.
In this paper, we compare the structures of three
online social networking services: Cyworld, MySpace, and
orkut, each with more than 10 million users, respectively.
We have access to complete data of Cyworld’s ilchon (friend)
relationships and analyze its degree distribution, clustering
property, degree correlation, and evolution over time. We
also use Cyworld data to evaluate the validity of snowball
sampling method, which we use to crawl and obtain par-
tial network topologies of MySpace and orkut. Cyworld,
the oldest of the three, demonstrates a changing scaling be-
havior over time in degree distribution. The latest Cyworld
data’s degree distribution exhibits a multi-scaling behavior,
while those of MySpace and orkut have simple scaling be-
haviors with diﬀerent exponents. Very interestingly, each
of the two exponents corresponds to the diﬀerent segments
in Cyworld’s degree distribution. Certain online social net-
working services encourage online activities that cannot be
easily copied in real life; we show that they deviate from
close-knit online social networks which show a similar de-
gree correlation pattern to real-life social networks.

INTRODUCTION

The Internet has been a vessel to expand our social net-
works in many ways. Social networking services (SNSs) are
one successful example of such a role. SNSs provide an on-
line private space for individuals and tools for interacting
with other people in the Internet. SNSs help people ﬁnd
others of a common interest, establish a forum for discus-
sion, exchange photos and personal news, and many more.
Cyworld, the largest SNS in South Korea, had already 10

million users 2 years ago, one fourth of the entire popula-
tion of South Korea. MySpace and orkut, similar social net-
working services, have also more than 10 million users each.
Recently, the number of MySpace users exceeded 80 million
with a growing rate of over a hundred thousand people per
day. It is reported that these SNSs “attract nearly half of all
web users” [1]. The goal of these services is to help people
establish an online presence and build social networks; and
to eventually exploit the user base for commercial purposes.
Thus the statistics and dynamics of these online social net-
works are of tremendous importance to social networking
service providers and those interested in online commerce.
The notion of a network structure in social relations dates
back about half a century. Yet, the focus of most sociological
studies has been interactions in small groups, not structures
of large and extensive networks. Diﬃculty in obtaining large
data sets was one reason behind the lack of structural study.
However, as reported in [2] recently, missing data may dis-
tort the statistics severely and it is imperative to use large
data sets in network structure analysis.

It is only very recently that we have seen research re-
sults from large networks. Novel network structures from
human societies and communication systems have been un-
veiled; just to name a few are the Internet and WWW [3] and
the patents, Autonomous Systems (AS), and aﬃliation net-
works [4]. Even in the short history of the Internet, SNSs are
a fairly new phenomenon and their network structures are
not yet studied carefully. The social networks of SNSs are
believed to reﬂect the real-life social relationships of people
more accurately than any other online networks. Moreover,
because of their size, they oﬀer an unprecedented opportu-
nity to study human social networks.

In this paper, we pose and answer the following questions:
What are the main characteristics of online social net-
works? Ever since the scale-free nature of the World-Wide
Web network has been revealed, a large number of networks
have been analyzed and found to have power-law scaling in
degree distribution, large clustering coeﬃcients, and a small
mean degrees of separation (so called the small-world phe-
nomenon). The networks we are interested in this work are
huge and those of this magnitude have not yet been ana-
lyzed.

How representive is a sample network? In most networks,
the analysis of the entire network is infeasible and sampling

WWW 2007 / Track: Semantic WebSession: Semantic Web and Web 2.0835is unavoidable. We evaluate the popular snowball sampling
method using the complete Cyworld network topology.

How does a social network evolve? From the historical
data of the Cyworld network, we reconstruct the past snap-
shots of Cyworld network. The evolution path of a social
network may exhibit patterns of major change.
It would
be of tremendous interest to latecomers, for it is literally a
prediction of what they might turn into.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we re-
view related works. In Section 3, we describe social network
topologies we have gained access to and, in Section 4, the
snowball sampling method and metrics of interest in net-
work analysis. Then we begin our topology analysis with
that of Cyworld. In Section 5, we analyze the friend rela-
tionship network of Cyworld, perform a historical analysis
on the network’s evolution, evaluate the snowball sampling
method, and compare a special subset of Cyworld network
(the network of testimonials) with the complete network,
and .
In Section 6, we analyze MySpace and orkut net-
works. We compare all three networks in Section 7, along
with a discussion on the origin of power-law in online social
networks and the resemblance to real social networks. We
conclude with a discussion on future work in Section 8.

2. RELATED WORKS

The structural propertes, such as degree distribution, of
large-scale social networks have received much attention since
the uncovering of the network of movie actors [3]. It is fol-
lowed by the analysis on the network of scientiﬁc collabora-
tion network [5] and the web of human sexual contacts [6].
However, a link in these networks is diﬀerent from a normal
friend relationship and the large-scale analysis on the such
networks has remained uncharted.

Recently, the rapid growth of online social networking ser-
vices made it possible to investigate the huge online social
network directly. Since the rise of Cyworld, many SNSs in-
cluding MySpace and orkut have grown. However, the anal-
yses on these huge networks have been limited to cultural
and business viewpoint [7].

Here, we introduce two relevant works on online social
networks. First work is on an Internet dating community,
called pussokram.com [8]. The dataset consists of about
30, 000 users and time series of all interactions. By network
analysis, fat tails are found in all degree distributions from
the networks made by several interaction layers: messages,
guest book, and ﬂirts. An interesting feature is super-heavy
tails which go beyond the trend of small degree region. An-
other work investigates an online blog community, LiveJour-
nal [9]. The number of users examined is 1, 312, 454, about
half of whom publicize their snail mail addresses. By ex-
amining this partial list of real addresses of bloggers, the
work uncovers the connection between online friendship and
geography. The network’s degree distribution also shows a
weak but signiﬁcant super-heavy tail, which deviates from
the trend of small degree region. The huge size of online
communities makes the sampling an inevitable process in
analyzing the networks. Recently, extensive simulations are
performed for several network sampling methods [10] and
the eﬀect of missing data in social network analysis is stud-
ied [2].

3. ONLINE SNSS

Social networking services (SNSs) provide users with an
online presence that contains shareable personal informa-
tion, such as a birthday, hobbies, preferences, photographs,
writings, etc. Most SNSs oﬀer features of convenience that
help users form and maintain an online network with other
users. One such feature is a “friend.” A user invites an-
other user to be one’s friend.
If the invited user accepts
the invitation, a friend relationship is established between
them. This friend feature is often used as a shortcut to
others’ front pages and, in some SNSs, a convenient tool to
exchange messages and stay in touch.

As SNSs have become very popular, leading sites boast of
an extensive user base of tens of millions of subscribers. For
this work, we have collected four sets of online social network
topology data from three popular SNSs. All of them have
more than 10 million users. We have obtained the entire
network topology of Cyworld directly from its provider, and
sampled others through web crawling. We believe our work
is the ﬁrst to analyze social networks of such magnitude. In
Table 1, we summarize the four data sets described above.
The metrics in the table are explained later in Section 4.

Below we describe each network in detail.

3.1 Cyworld

Cyworld is the largest and oldest online social networking
service in South Korea.
It began operation in September
2001, and its growth has been explosive ever since. Cy-
world’s 12 million registered users, as of November 2005,
are an impressive number, considering the total population
of 48 million in South Korea. As any SNS, Cyworld oﬀers
users to establish, maintain and dissolve a friend (called il-
chon) relationship online.

From SK Communications, Inc. the provider of the Cy-
world service, we received an anonymized snapshot of the
Cyworld user network taken in November 2005. The snap-
shot contains 191 million friend relationships among 12 mil-
lion users. We have access to additional data to study the
network evolution and describe it in Section 5.2.

Cyworld oﬀers a mechanism called ilchon pyung for friends
to leave a testimonial on a user’s front page1 Friends can
leave one testimonial each, though modiﬁable more than
once, and it usually describes one’s impression or a word of
encouragement. Not all friends write a testimonial and thus
it can be construed as a manifestation of a close relationship
in real life. We have decided to include testimonials in our
analysis for comparison with the complete Cyworld network.
We have used snowball sampling and collected testimonials
from about 100,000 users. Note that the testimonial network
is a directional graph, where a link represents one user’s
testimonial on another user’s front page, and the complete
Cyworld friend network is an undirected graph.

3.2 MySpace

As of November 2006, MySpace is the largest social net-
working service in the world, with more than 130 million
users.
It began its service in July 2003, and the number
of users grew explosively. According to Alexa.com2, it is
the world’s 5th most popular website (4th among English
websites).
1Only 101 testimonials were allowed on front page originally,
but the restriction was lifted.

Table 1: Summary of data sets from online social networking services

A new user in MySpace by default gets a friend relation-
ship with Tom Anderson, the cofounder of MySpace.
In
our dataset, we exclude links to him, since he has links to
everyone. MySpace oﬀers similar features with other social
networking services, such as writing testimonials to friends
on their front pages, checking upcoming birthdays, shortcuts
to friends’ front pages.

We have obtained 100,000 user information from the MyS-
pace friend network by crawling the MySpace online web site
from September to October, 2006. The crawler randomly se-
lects a starting user site, and crawl the user’s friends’ pages,
their friends’ pages, and so on. We have left out users who
do not publicize their ﬁrends’ list, and the amount of those
users were about 23% out of all the nodes we have crawled.

3.3 orkut

In September 2002, orkut began its trial service by a few
Google employees, and became an oﬃcial Google service in
January 2004. Until recently, orkut accounts were given
only to people invited by already existing users, which is
diﬀerent from Cyworld or MySpace. As it has permitted
any user to create an account without invitation, it has ex-
panded fast; the number of users reached 1 million at the
end of July and surpassed 2 million by the end of September
20043. Today, the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.
Once a user joins orkut, one can publish one’s own proﬁle,
upload photos, and join communities of interest. Orkut also
oﬀers friend relationship. The maximum number of friends
per user was limited to 1000, but this limit has also been
lifted. Crawling in a similar way to MySpace, we have col-
lected orkut friendship data on 100,000 users from June to
September, 2006.

4. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

In this section, we outline the sampling method employed
to crawl and capture MySpace and orkut networks, and de-
scribe brieﬂy the metrics of topological characteristics and
their interpretations.

4.1 Snowball sampling

We have gained access to the entire topology of Cyworld
through human contact, but were not successful with MyS-
pace or orkut. Falling back on crawling for data collection,
we are limited in the number of nodes we could crawl in a
ﬁnite time frame.

There are several network sampling methods: node sam-
pling, link sampling, and snowball sampling [10]. In node

3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orkut

sampling, we randomly select a fraction of nodes. Links
between selected nodes are included in the ﬁnal sample net-
work. Link sampling is similar. We randomly select a frac-
tion of links and construct a sample network. In contrast,
snowball sampling randomly selects one seed node and per-
forms a breadth-ﬁrst search (hence the name, snowball sam-
pling), until the number of selected nodes reaches the desired
sampling ratio. Only those links between selected nodes are
included in the ﬁnal sample network.

The snowball sampling method is the only feasible one
to crawl the web for the following reasons. First, node and
link sampling methods are highly ineﬃcient in practice, as
accessing nodes or links randomly is simply not doable. Sec-
ondly, if the sampling fraction is not large enough, the sam-
ple network is likely to have many isolated clusters and be
far from the original network in many aspects of interest.
Furthermore, the expected mean degree of the sample net-
work is always much smaller than of the original network.
In short, we always underestimate the node degree, cannot
estimate the degree of separation, nor ﬁnd hubs (nodes with
a very large number of neighbors), if we use node or link
sampling.

The main estimation error of the snowball sampling lies in
the likelihood of oversampled hubs [10], for they have many
links and are easily picked up in the ﬁrst few rounds of the
breadth-ﬁrst search. In order to evaluate the deviating im-
pact of snowball sampling on the metrics of interest, we take
full advantage of the complete Cyworld network and com-
pare various metrics between partial and complete networks.
It is known that the power-law nature in the degree distri-
bution is well conserved under snowball sampling [10] since
the snowball sampling method easily picks up hubs. This
property reduces the degree exponent and produces a heav-
ier tail, but it is very diﬃcult to get a power-law degree
distribution from a network without the power-law decay-
ing degree distribution.

4.2 Metrics of interest

We begin the analysis of online social network topolo-
gies by looking at their degree distributions. Networks of
a power-law degree distribution, P (k) ∼ k−γ, where k is the
node degree and γ ≤ 3, attest to the existence of a relatively
small number of nodes with a very large number of links.
These networks also have distinguishing properties, such as
vanishing epidemic threshold, ultra-small worldness, and ro-
bustness under random errors [11, 12, 13, 14]. The degree
distribution is often plotted as a complementary cumulative
probability function (CCDF), ℘(k) ≡ R ∞
k P (k′)dk′ ∼ k−α ∼
k−(γ−1). As a power-law distribution shows up as a straight

WWW 2007 / Track: Semantic WebSession: Semantic Web and Web 2.0837line in a log-log plot, the exponent of a power-law distri-
bution is a representative characteristic, distinguishing one
from others.

Next, we examine the clustering coeﬃcient. The cluster-
ing coeﬃcient of a node is the ratio of the number of existing
links over the number of possible links between its neighbors.
Given a network G = (V, E), a clustering coeﬃcient, Ci, of
node i ∈ V is:

Ci = 2|{(v, w)|(i, v), (i, w), (v, w) ∈ E}|/ki(ki − 1)

(1)

where ki is the degree of node i. It can be interpreted as the
probability that any two randomly chosen nodes that share
a common neighbor have a link between them. For any node
in a tightly-connected mesh network, the clustering coeﬃ-
cient is 1. The clustering coeﬃcient of a node represents
how well connected its neighbors are. The clustering coef-
ﬁcient of a network is the mean clustering coeﬃcient of all
nodes. Often it is insightful to examine not only the mean
clustering coeﬃcient, but its distribution. We denote the
mean clustering coeﬃcient of degree k as C(k) and analyze
its distribution. Unless stated otherwise, the clustering co-
eﬃcient in the rest of the paper refers to the mean clustering
coeﬃcient of a network.

The degree correlation, knn, is a mapping between a node
degree k and the mean degree of nearest neighbors of those
nodes of degree k.
Its distribution is often characterized
by the assortativity (r), which is deﬁned as the Pearson
correlation coeﬃcient of the degrees of either nodes which is
connected by a link [15]. It is expressed as follows:

r =

hkikji − hkiihkji

q(hk2

i i − hkii2)(hk2

j i − hkji2)

,

(2)

where ki and kj are degrees of the nodes located at either
end of a link and the h·i notation represents the average over
all links.

If a network’s assorativity is negative, a hub tends to be
connected to non-hubs, and vice versa. When r > 0, we
call the network to have an assortative mixing pattern, and
when r < 0, disassortative mixing. Most social networks
exhibit an assortative mixing pattern, whereas other net-
works show a disassortative mixing pattern [15, 16]. The
assortative mixing pattern is considered as a unique char-
acteristic of social networks and its origin was suggested as
rich community structures of human relationships [17].

As introduced in Stanley Milgram’s experiment of mail
forwarding [18], the degree of separation (ℓ) is the mean
distance between any two nodes of the network. Accurate
calculation of the degree of separation or the average path
length, as we call it in this paper, requires the knowledge
of the entire topology and the time complexity of O(N L),
where L is the number of links and N is the number of
nodes. In huge networks like Cyworld, MySpace, and orkut,
the calculation is infeasible. Only approximation is possible.
From a snowball sample network, we measure the number
of nodes at each round of breadth-ﬁrst search. By extrapo-
lating this number sequence, we predict how many steps are
needed to cover the entire network, and obtain an estimate
of the average path length by the following formula [19].

log(N/n1)
log(n2/n1)

+ 1,

(3)

where N is the total number of nodes and n1 and n2 are the
average numbers of ﬁrst and second neighbors respectively.

Palmer et al. propose an approximation for the eﬀective
diameter of a massive graph [20]. The eﬀective diameter is
the 90th-percentile of the path length distribution, and is a
better metric than the maximum diameter in estimating the
network size, as the maximum diameter can be an outlier
from a small number of nodes forming a chain. Palmer’s
approach is useful when the complete network topology is
known, but too large to load on memory and calculate the
exact neighborhood function. As our Cyworld topology can
be loaded onto our server’s 4 GB memory and complete
network topologies of MySpace and orkut are not available,
we do not use their approximation. For Cyworld data, we
estimate the average path length and the eﬀective diameter
from sample networks and use (3) to calculate average path
lengths for MySpace and orkut networks.

5. ANALYSIS OF CYWORLD

We begin our network analysis with the Cyworld data set.
As it is the most extensive data set we have, this section in-
cludes basic analysis of topology-related metrics, evaluation
of the snowball sampling method, historical analysis of the
network evolution, and online networks’ similarity to real-
life social networks.
In Section 5.1, we ﬁrst calculate the
degree distribution, clustering coeﬃcient distribution, and
degree correlation distribution of the complete Cyworld net-
work. Then we study how the Cyworld network has evolved
over time in Section 5.2. In Sction 5.3, we evaluate the snow-
ball sampling method by comparing sample networks to the
complete Cyworld network. In Section 5.4, we analyze the
network of testimonials.

5.1 Complete friend relationship network

The ﬁrst metric we investigate is the degree distribution.
Figure 1(a) plots the complementary cumulative distribu-
tion function (CCDF) of the complete Cyworld friend rela-
tionship network, Set I. Most networks in nature and human
societies have a power-law degree distribution with a single
exponent, γ, between 2 and 3, attesting to the existence of
hubs or people with a very large number of friends. However,
the Cyworld network shows two diﬀerent scaling regions as
in Figure 1(a). The crossover takes place between k = 100
and k = 1000 and divides the CCDF into two regions: a
rapid decaying (γ ∼ 5) region and a heavy tailed (γ ∼ 2) re-
gion. This behavior has not been reported previously about
any SNS topologies. (Note that the exponent of a CCDF
is smaller than the exponent of a probability distribution
function itself by one.) The multi-scaling behavior observed
in Cyworld suggests that Cyworld consists of two diﬀerent
types of networks, i.e., two types of users. Further analysis
of distributions of the clustering coeﬃcient and the degree
correlation also support the existence of heterogeneous types
of users. We revisit this issue in Section 5.3 against the anal-
ysis of sample networks and discuss further in comparison
with other social networks in Section 7.

Next, we examine the clustering coeﬃcient. Figure 1(b)
displays the entire distribution of the clustering coeﬃcient,
C(k), versus degree k. (Figures 1(b) and 1(c) also include
graphs from the testimonial networks that we defer discus-
sion on until Section 5.4.) The average clustering coeﬃcient
of the Cyworld network is 0.16, which is smaller than those
of other network data sets to be discussed in later sections.
It implies that Cyworld friend relationships are more loosely

connected than other networks. However, a closer examina-
tion of the clustering coeﬃcient distribution reveals that it
actually has two diﬀerent scaling regions, as in the degree
distribution. Up until k = 500, the graph of the clustering
coeﬃcient distribution has a power-law distribution with an
exponent of 0.4. Then beyond k = 500, the graph suddenly
drops and disperses. (The dispersion is mainly due to small
number of nodes in that region.) That is, neighbors of nodes
with degree larger than 500 are very loosely connected and
diﬀerent from those of nodes with smaller degrees.

We plot the distribution of degree correlation, knn, of the
complete Cyworld network in Figure 1(c). It exhibits not a
simple pattern, but a more complex and intractable one, just
as the degree distribution of Figure 1(a) or the clustering co-
eﬃcient distribution of Figure 1(b) do. If a network has an
assortative mixing pattern, the degree correlation distribu-
tion exhibits an increasing scaling behavior; if disassorative,
then a decreasing one. The overall trend of Figure 1(c) is
decreasing, and the Cyworld network’s assortativity is a neg-
ative value: −0.13. As human social networks are known to
exhibit an assortative mixing pattern from hubs attracting
hubs, lack of such a pattern and the complex, heterogeneous
structure in the degree correlation distribution imply mixing
of diﬀerent types of users.

Far-fetched, we could claim that the top left corner of Fig-
ure 1(c) shows negative correlation and the remaining up-
per cluster displays (although very slight) positive correla-
tion, which is the main characteristic of social networks [17].
The degree correlation of large hubs seems to be neutral or
slightly disassortative. We revisit this issue later with sam-
ple network analysis in Section 5.3.

Figure 2: Probability distribution function of dis-
tances between nodes

Leskovec et al. reports that the average node degree of
a wide range of real graphs increases over time and thus

the graphs densify [4]. They also report that the eﬀective
diameters of those graphs shrink over time.

We estimate the average path length between nodes from
sample networks. We randomly choose a seed node, run a
breadth-ﬁrst search of the network, and obtain a distribu-
tion of path lengths between the seed and all other nodes.
We repeat this network sampling with 100, 2000, and 3000
seeds, and obtain Figure 2. The inset in the ﬁgure plots the
cumulative distribution function. We can tell from the ﬁg-
ures that the average path length between 90% of nodes is
less than 6, even though the maximum distance may reach
18, more than double the value for 90%. In order to conﬁrm
that the distribution of the average path length eventually
converge to that of the complete network, we have looked at
the incremental change as the number of sample networks
increased. We observe that the root mean square of the
diﬀerence between the empirical probability density distri-
butions of sample networks with h and (h + 1) seeds steadily
decreases ﬁtting to the y = 1/x line, conﬁrming that our es-
timation would converge to the true average path length.

Figure 3: Comparison of the national population,
Internet users, and Cyworld users

As of March 2006, the population of Korea reached 48
million, and there were 24 million Internet users of ages
over 15, the 6th largest in the world [21]. Internet users can
be classiﬁed as “weekly” users, if they use the Internet at
least once a week, or “daily” users, if they do every day.
According to a market research company, Korean Click, the
number of weekly users in 2000 was about 15 million and
that of daily users was 10 million. When we extrapolate the
numbers of daily and weekly users from 2000 to March 2006
along the increase in the overall Internet users, we obtain
the graphs labeled as weekly and daily in Figure 3.

Figure 4: Evolution of the topological characteristics of Cyworld.

From Table 1, we know that the number of Cyworld users
reached 12 million in November 2005.
In addition to Set
I, we have acquired several other data sets to investigate
the historical growth of Cyworld. We have monthly statis-
tics on the total numbers of Cyworld users from the very
beginning of the Cyworld service in 1999, as well as the
numbers of users with friend relationships. The former in-
cludes all users with or without any friend relationship. We
have acquired two additional snapshots of existing friend re-
lationships from April and September of 2005, which we call
Snapshots I and II, respectively. Snapshots I and II, as well
as Set I, include friend relationships. In other words, those
users who have not established any friend relationship are
not included. We also have acquired partial data (about
42%) on dates of establishments and dissolutions of friend
relationships from SK Communications, Inc., which we call
Dated Partial Set (DPS). Due to lack of knowledge about
the biases in DPS, we assume that it is a random sample.
We reconstruct partial friend relationship networks at every
six month interval starting in December of 2002 from Dated
Partial Set.

Figure 3 plots all the historical data we have about Cy-
world, the Internet users, and the Korean population. The
curvy graph just below the extrapolated line of daily Inter-
net users represents the all-inclusive Cyworld users and the
graph below it represents only those with friend relation-
ships. The latter overlaps with three data points obtained
from Snapshots I and II and Set I. They do not coincide ex-
actly, for data was collected on diﬀerent dates and marginal
diﬀerences exist between data sets.

The total numbers of all-inclusive Cyworld users and those
with friend relationships follow each other closely up until
June 2004 and start to deviate. In June 2006, the gap be-
tween the two widens to over 4 million. The dramatic in-
crease in the number of users without friend relationships
could be contributed to several factors. One of the most
likely factors is additional services oﬀered by SK Commu-
nications, Inc. that require a Cyworld membership. People
who want to use the service, but are not interested in SNS
only join Cyworld and do not engage in building a social
network. Whether a Cyworld user has a friend or not, the
number of Cyworld users almost reaches the extrapolated
number of daily Internet users in Korea in December 2005,
about a third of the entire Korean population and more than
60% of Internet users. Considering the language barrier, it
is unlikely that the user demography of Cyworld expands
outside Korea much, as Brazilians represent a very active
and signiﬁcant portion in orkut or there are many Spanish-
speaking users in MySpace. Thus we may conclude that

Cyworld has reached saturation in terms of the number of
users.

The lowest graph in Figure 3 represents partial networks
reconstructed from Dated Partial Set based on the date
information of relationship establishment and dissolution.
Partial friend relationship networks obtained from DPSs
clearly do not sample the complete network equally every
six months. However, we note that the sampling ratios in
terms of the number of nodes are always higher than 5%.

In order to study the historical growth of Cyworld in
depth, we use 3 reconstructed partial networks from DPS,
each in December of 2002, 2003, 2004, and Set1 from 2005.
We refer to those DPS sets as DPS I, II, III, respectively.
These networks are not snowball sampled, but are good rep-
resentations of the complete networks, thanks due to the
high sampling ratios of 5% or higher. Using these four sets,
we study how the Cyworld network has evolved over time
in terms of the degree distribution, the clustering coeﬃcient
distribution, and the degree correlation distribution.

We ﬁrst plot the CCDF of the degree distributions in Fig-
ure 4(a), and study the evolution of the degree distribution.
The graph of DPS I is the shortest, reaching only up to
k = 1000. It is close to a straight line, and we cannot see
if it has a multi-scaling behavior. The graph of DPS II ex-
tends longer than that of DPS I and the tail part for k > 100
starts to exhibit a diﬀerent slope. However, it is only with
DPSs III and Set I that the multi-scaling behavior is clearly
pronounced. From Figure 4, we can infer that user hetero-
geneity has started to materialize around December 2004.

In Figure 4(b) we plot the distributions of clustering co-
eﬃcients from December 2002, 2004, and November 2005.
The distribution from December 2003 is very similar to that
of 2004 and is omitted in order to avoid cluttering the plot.
Up until December 2004, the distribution of clustering coeﬃ-
cient, C(k), is not power-law and looks similar from one year
to another. From 2004 to 2005, the distribution of clustering
coeﬃcient changes signiﬁcantly, and shows diﬀerent regions
of scaling behavior in November 2005. The degree correla-
tion from December 2002, plotted in the lower left corner
of Figure 4(c), exhibits an disassortative mixing pattern for
k ≤ 50, but no clear pattern for k ≥ 50. The disassortative
mixing pattern continues to manifest up to December 2004
for k ≤ 50. In December 2005, as we have observed already,
the disassortative mixing pattern for k ≤ 100 is no longer
clear, and the degree correlation for k ≥ 100 is spread out.
The manifestation of diﬀerent types of users is shown in all
plots of metrics.

As a last metric of historical analysis, we examine the evo-
lution of the average path length and the eﬀective diameter.

Figure 5: Average path length vs time

In Figure 5, we plot the log of the total number of nodes,
the average path length, and the eﬀective diameter as de-
scribed in Sections 4.2 and 5.1. We use DPSs I to IV, as well
as reconstructed networks from the original DPS for June
of 2003, 2004, and 2005. Previously, a complex network is
known to have the average path length scale logarithmically
to the number of nodes, while a power-law network with
2 ≤ γ ≤ 3 scales to log(log(N )). However, recent study by
Leskovec et al. has reported that a wide range of graphs
exhibit a densiﬁcation trend and their diameters shrink over
time [4].

In case of Cyworld, the average path length increases up
to June 2004, and then starts to decrease, while the eﬀec-
tive diameter vascillates until June 2004 and decreases af-
terwards. Due to space limitation, we only report that the
number of nodes plotted against number of edges plotted in
log-log scale exhibits a power-law distribution and thus the
Cyworld network concurs to the same densiﬁcation trend.

We plot the eﬀective diameter in Figure 5 and observe
that it increases for the ﬁrst year and a half of Cyworld
service, and then starts to decrease. This junction coincides
with the point in time when the number of users without
friend relationships increases and the multi-scaling behavior
starts to manifest in the degree distribution. We conjecture
that the Cyworld has reached a saturation point as an active
friend relationship network, and then graph densiﬁcation has
taken over, resulting in a decrease of both the average path
length and the eﬀective diameter.

5.3 Evaluation of the snowball sampling method

As discussed in Section 4.1, snowball sampling is a bet-
ter technique than node or link sampling methods, if its
tendency to overrepresent hubs can be deliberated. In this
section, we simulate a snowball sampling crawl on the com-
plete Cyworld network, and evaluate the estimation error in
snowball sampling.

Here we randomly select 10 diﬀerent seed nodes with k >
100 and get 10 sample networks starting from each seed.
We set the sampling ratio to 0.33%, resulting in the ﬁnal
40, 000 nodes in each sample network. Starting from seed
nodes with smaller degrees does not make a diﬀerence, for
within a few rounds of breadth-ﬁrst search, a hub of k > 100
is reached, almost certainly as expected from the power-law
degree distribution.

Figure 6(a) plots the CCDF of the degree distributions
of all 10 sample networks of Cyworld. For a reference, we
include the cumulative degree distribution of the complete
Cyworld network as an inset. The cumulative degree distri-

butions of sample networks have similar multi-scaling behav-
iors to that of the complete network: there are two regions
of slow and rapid decaying. The exponents of the rapid de-
caying region range from 3.2 to 3.8, and those of the heavy
tailed region from 1.2 to 1.8. As observed in [10], the expo-
nents of sample networks are supposed to be smaller than
that of the complete network. We can summarize sample
networks have varying smaller degree exponents than the
complete network, but clearly the same multi-region scaling
behavior.

Out of the above 10 sample networks, we choose two sam-
ple networks randomly and plot only the two in the rest
of the analysis for convenience. We veriﬁed that including
other sample networks did not change the qualitative con-
clusion in our analysis. Figure 6(b) depicts the distributions
of clustering coeﬃcient, C(k), of the two sample networks
and the complete network. Recall that the complete net-
work had a very clean scaling behavior up to k = 500 with
an exponent of 0.4. The limited scaling behavior in the com-
plete network vanishes; moreover, the two sample networks
exhibit no scaling behavior in their clustering coeﬃcient dis-
tributions.

The average clustering coeﬃcient of sample networks are
larger than 0.16 of the complete network. The mean cluster-
ing coeﬃcient of all 10 sample networks is 0.29. However, the
converging behavior of the clustering coeﬃcient (whether it
increases or not) under the snowball sampling is not deter-
ministic in general [10] and we cannot predict whether the
original clustering coeﬃcient of orkut and MySpace is larger
than those from sample networks.

We plot the degree correlation distributions of the two
sample and complete networks of Cyworld in Figure 6(c).
The sample networks exhibit a more deﬁnite disassortative
mixing pattern in their degree correlation distribution. The
distributions from the two sample networks exhibit a clear
decreasing pattern for k < 100 and then disperse.

In our preliminary work, we have evaluated how close
topological characteristics of snowball sampled networks are
to the complete network as we vary the sampling ratios [22].
From our numerical analysis, we suggest a practical guide-
line on the sampling ratio for accurate estimation of the
topological metrics, excluding the clustering coeﬃcient, where
the explicit sampling ratio for accurate estimation is charted
for the other metrics; 0.25% or larger for degree distribution,
0.2% or larger for degree correlation, and 0.9% or larger for
assortativity. In the case of the clustering coeﬃcient, even
with a sampling ratio of 2%, it is inconclusive if the cluster-
ing coeﬃcient of the sample network has converged close to
that of the complete network.

In summary, we observe the same multi-scaling behavior
in degree distribution from sample networks, while the ex-
ponents of the distributions are diﬀerent from that of the
complete network. Other metrics, such as the clustering
coeﬃcient distribution, its mixing pattern, and the degree
correlation, are not easy to estimate from samples. Though
not rigorously validated, we demonstrate that only with a
sampling ratio above a certain threshold, the scaling behav-
ior of the node degree distribution is captured correctly in
sample networks.

5.4 Testimonial network

As described in Section 3.1, a testimonial represents a di-
rectional relationship of intimacy and interest in Cyworld.

Figure 7: Cumulative distribution of in-degree and
out-degrees of Cyworld’s testimonial network

We have collected a sample network of 100,000 nodes for
our testimonial network analysis. In contrast to the com-
plete Cyworld network, both the in-degree and out-degree
distributions of the sampled network show an exponential
distribution. There is a sharp cut-oﬀ in in-degree distri-
bution around k ∼ 100 which is due to the fact that the
testimonial space is limited in the front page. However, the
few data points near k ∼ 200 in the out-degree distribu-
tion indicates that some users leave extraordinarily many
testimonials on others’ front pages.

To evaluate other metrics, we need an undirected net-
work. We consider each link in this testimonial network as
bidirectional in the following analysis. The clustering coef-
ﬁcient of Cyworld testimonial network is 0.32. As discussed
before, the clustering coeﬃcient from a sample network is
hard to evaluate and we only report the value of 0.4. How-
ever the distribution of clustering coeﬃcients as shown in
Figure 1(b) has a clear scaling behavior, and the degree cor-
relation in Figure 1(c) demonstrates an assortative mixing,
a clearn sign of human social networking. We also estimate
the average path length and it is about 7, larger than those
of the friend relationship network shown in Figure 5.

In summary, the testimonial network of Cyworld is a sub-
set of the complete Cyworld friend network. However, its
topological characteristics deviate from the complete net-
work: it has exponential degree distributions, clear positive
degree correlation and rather a large average path length.
The testimonial network represents more tight and close-

knit relationships than the simple friends network. Accord-
ingly, the testimonial network shows a positive degree cor-
relation, which is a unique property of the social networks.

6. ANALYSIS OF ORKUT AND MYSPACE
Figure 8(a) shows the degree distributions of orkut and
MySpace. The degree distribution of orkut exhibits clear
power-law with degree exponent γ ∼ 3.7. There is a cutoﬀ
around k ∼ 103, which is due to orkut’s old policy that the
number of friends cannot exceed 1000. The degree distri-
bution of MySpace also shows power-law with degree expo-
nent γ ∼ 3.1, which is rather slow-decay in comparison with
orkut. Users in MySpace have more friends than users in
orkut. Thus, the degree distribution is broader. We should
note that as in the sampling analysis of Cyworld, the sam-
pling fraction of MySpace is not conclusive enough, thus,
multi-scaling behavior might not be observed, even if it ex-
ists. Figure 8(b) shows the distributions of clustering coeﬃ-
cient. C(k) of orkut shows a tendency to decrease, but it is
not evident. Our former analysis on the samples of Cyworld
suggests that the decay in the real C(k) of orkut is more
rapid than observed. The similar tendency is observed from
the MySpace.

The decreasing tendency of the degree correlation of orkut
in the small and large degree region shown in Figure 8(c)
may come from the eﬀect shown in Cyworld sampling or the
invitation system of orkut. Until recently, users could regis-
ter to orkut only when he was invited by a user in orkut. So,
new users were likely to be connected to heavy users. How-
ever, it now permits users to create accounts without an
invitation. The assortativity of orkut friend network is 0.31.
Orkut shares the property of the positive assortative mixing
with the testimonial network of Cyworld, which is consid-
ered as a close-knit community. In contrast, the MySpace
network’s assortativity is almost neutral, r ∼ 0.02. Note
that Figure 8(c) is depicted in log-log scale. In addition, the
decay in degree distribution is rapid, even it is not exponen-
tial like the testimonial network of Cyworld.

Since we only have data from a single seed, the estima-
tion of degrees of separation for orkut and MySpace is much
rougher than the case of Cyworld. In order to reduce the
error, we let the number of ﬁrst neighbors (n1) as the mean
degree we measured, and we tune the number of second
neighbors (n2) as to preserve the ratio of the number of ﬁrst
and second neighbors by assuming that the ratio (n2/n1) is
not so sensitive to the n1. Note that the value n2/n1 can-
not ﬂuctuate much due to the averaging eﬀect, when the
degree correlation is not strong. The calculated degrees of

separation of orkut is 3.8, which is a little larger than that
of Cyworld. The degrees of separation of MySpace is calcu-
lated in the same way with orkut and the value is 2.7, which
is the smallest value among our data sets, while the size of
myspace is the largest.

7. DISCUSSION

7.1 Comparison of Cyworld, MySpace, and

orkut

We plot the three degree distributions of Cyworld, MyS-
pace, and orkut together in Figure 8(a) for ease of com-
parison.
In Figure 8(a), to compare the exponents more
easily, the degree distribution graph of MySpace is rescaled
and shifted to align with the heavy-tailed region of Cyworld
while the range of both axes are identical to others. As
seen previously, Cyworld has a multi-scaling behavior, while
MySpace and orkut exhibit simple power-law.

From Figure 8(a), we observe an interesting relation be-
tween the three degree distributions. The exponent of orkut
matches that of the rapid decaying region of Cyworld, while
the exponent of MySpace matches that of the heavy-tailed
region of Cyworld. The exponent of orkut is γ = 3.7 and,
for Cyworld, γ = 5. The two exponents are not exactly the
same. However, as shown in Section 5.3, sample networks
tend to have smaller exponents than the complete network
and we circumspect that the real exponent of orkut be close
to that of Cyworld’s rapid decaying region. The exponent
of MySpace is γ = 3.1 and that of Cyworld’s heavy-tailed
region, γ = 2.
If we apply the same reasoning as in the
case of orkut, the exponent of the complete MySpace net-
work is probably larger than γ = 3.1. However, we expect
it to be closer to that of Cyworld’s heavy-tailed region than
to that of orkut. Other quantitative relations give us more
hints. The testimonial network’s assortativity is the biggest,
and that of Cyworld lies between that of orkut and MyS-
pace. Same relation happens also in the degrees of separa-
tion. The testimonial network’s degrees of separation is the
largest, and that of Cyworld lies between that of orkut and
MySpace. This peculiar correspondence is another corrob-
orating evidence that Cyworld’s heterogeneity comes from
the mixing of two types of users: one, with an orkut-like
structure and the other with a MySpace-like structure.

Orkut is considered a relatively closed community, for
a new user can register only by invitation. Relations in
MySpace might be considered loose, as anyone can sign up
without invitation and many are attracted to popularity, of

which phenomenon stemming from early days as a popular
site for the music community. The main webpage publishes
“cool new people” and connecting to a new online friend is
not a serious invitation-only aﬀair. Cyworld has been a very
private space in South Korea. By default, the list of friends
is not made public, and neither are the photos and writings.
On the other hand, Cyworld has also many features that
encourage the creation of hubs. It picks two persons every
day and puts their photos and link to their front pages at
the main page.
It is similar to the ”cool new people” in
MySpace. Moreover, Cyworld also has the club service that
provides a homepage for various online communities. The
organizer of a club tends to acquire many friends through
the club activity.

Previous work has hinted at a multi-scaling behavior for
online social networks. Holme et al. analyze the multitudes
of layers of an Internet dating community: messages, guest
books, and ﬂirts.
In all layers, the degree distribution is
power-law, with the tail slightly heavier than normal [8].
Liben-Nowell et al. shows the degree distribution of a net-
work of more than one million bloggers and it also has a
short, but heavy tail [9]. Neither network has a reference
network for comparison and its scaling behavior was not ex-
plicable. Our analysis of Cyworld is a conﬁrmation that
those previous revelations are not an isolated incident, but
stem from a ﬁrm underlying structure in online social net-
works.

7.2 Origins of power(cid:173)law behavior in online

social networks

The origin of power-law has been extensively studied and
there are many mechanisms that produce power-law dis-
tributions. Which of those best explains the origin of the
power-law in online social networks? The best known mech-
anism to generate power-law distributions is preferential at-
tachment. Not only the well-known Barab´asi-Albert model,
but also many other mechanisms implicitly use preferen-
tial attachment. The transitive linking model [23], which
is based on continuously completing triangles with only an
edge missing, is one such example. Another noticeable view-
point is ﬁtness-based approaches. In any ﬁtness-based ap-
proach, each node has its own ﬁtness value and they are
linked by the function of their ﬁtness values [24, 25, 26]. In
the case of the online social networks, both the preferential
attachment and the ﬁtness-based approach may contribute.
More attractive and active persons are likely to have many
online friends. Moreover, as one has more friends, it gets
easier to have more friends through the transitive linking

(a common friend of two persons introduces them to each
other).

A real-life social relation is harder to maintain than the
online counterpart. When online, you do not move to a
new place nor spend much time to make new friends.
It
is a lot easier to leave a message to online friends than to
meet a friend in real life. And as told about Cyworld users’
behavior, most online relations are not severed, even when
not active. Dunbar claimed that the brain size in primates
(including human beings) is correlated with the size of a
community that they can manage. He estimated the mean
community size of a human being to be about 147.8 [27]. In-
triguingly enough, in Cyworld’s friend relationship network,
the crossover between two scaling regions takes place where
100 ≤ k ≤ 500, in the same order as Dunbar’s law suggests.

7.3 Online networks like real social networks
We conjecture that Cyworld’s testimonial network is very
similar to oﬀ-line social networks. First, strangers cannot
write a testimonial , but only conﬁrmed friends can. Even
out of conﬁrmed friends, not all are tempted or care enough
to write a testimonial on a friend’s front page for the rest
of friends to view. Thus the testimonial network should be
as an extremely close-knit community. Its close-knit nature
is demonstrated by the exponentially decreasing degree dis-
tribution that decays more rapidly than power-law and has
a deﬁnite cutoﬀ. It also has an very clear assortative mix-
ing pattern which is a major feature of social networks. We
conclude that the testimonial network is the closest of the
four online social networks to real-life social networks.

8. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the complete network of an online so-
cial networking service, Cyworld. In addition, we have also
analyzed sample networks from Cyworld, orkut, and MyS-
pace in terms of degree distribution, clustering coeﬃcient,
degree correlation, and average path length.

We report a multi-scaling behavior in Cyworld’s degree
distribution and have substantiated our claim that hetero-
geneous types of users are the force behind the behavior with
detailed analysis of the clustering coeﬃcient distribution, as-
sortativity (or disassortativity), and the historical evolution
of the network size, the average path length, and the eﬀec-
tive diameter. The observation that the scaling exponents
of MySpace and orkut match those from diﬀerent regions in
the Cyworld network is also worthy of note.
