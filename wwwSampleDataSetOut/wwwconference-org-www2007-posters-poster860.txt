ABSTRACT
Scholarly entities, such as articles, journals, authors and in-
stitutions, are now mostly ranked according to expert opin-
ion and citation data. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
funded MESUR project at the Los Alamos National Lab-
oratory is developing metrics of scholarly impact that can
rank a wide range of scholarly entities on the basis of their
usage. The MESUR project starts with the creation of a
semantic network model of the scholarly community that
integrates bibliographic, citation, and usage data collected
from publishers and repositories world-wide. It is estimated
that this scholarly semantic network will include approxi-
mately 50 million articles, 1 million authors, 10,000 jour-
nals and conference proceedings, 500 million citations, and
1 billion usage-related events; the largest scholarly seman-
tic network ever created. The developed scholarly semantic
network will then serve as a standardized platform for the
deﬁnition and validation of new metrics of scholarly impact.
This poster describes the MESUR project’s data aggrega-
tion and processing techniques including the OWL scholarly
ontology that was developed to model the scholarly commu-
nication process.

INTRODUCTION

The most commonly applied metric for determining the
value of a journal and thus its authors and their institutions
is the ISI1 Impact Factor (IF) [6]. It is increasingly being
used in promotion and funding decisions.
It has also had
a signiﬁcant impact on the publication habits of researchers
worldwide. There are however a number of well-documented
limitations to the ISI IF; citation data lags scholarly trends
due to publication delays, the ISI IF is calculated for only
about 9,000 journals, journal level statistics do not accu-
rately represent the value of a particular article, and the
semantics of citation (e.g. disagreement vs. endorsement) is
not always clear.

Whereas millions of articles are stored in repositories world-
wide, an even large number of scholarly usage events occur
on a daily basis, e.g. downloads and abstract views. This
usage may provide a more accurate and reﬁned insight into
scholarly impact [4, 3] and at a shorter time-scale than ci-
tation data can provide [7, 5, 2]. However, in spite of nu-
merous scientiﬁc explorations demonstrating the value of us-
age data, usage-based metrics of scholarly impact have not
achieved any degree of community-acceptance. This can be
attributed to the lack of standards to record, represent and
aggregate usage data and the absence of a systematic inves-
tigation of the properties of various potential usage-based
impact metrics.

The MESUR2 project at the Digital Library Research and
Prototyping team of the Los Alamos National Laboratory is
in the process of constructing the largest scholarly seman-
tic network ever created which integrates bibliographic and
citation data with usage data obtained from various world-
wide service providers, e.g. publishers, institutions, library
consortia, etc. This scholarly semantic network provides
a standardized framework to perform a 2-year systematic
study of usage-based metrics which will result in a set of
guidelines and speciﬁcations with regards to their proper-
ties and appropriate applications. The MESUR project will
develop metrics using various algorithms drawn from graph
theory, semantic network theory, and statistics, along with
theoretical techniques developed internal to the project and
cross-validated with existing metrics such as the ISI IF, the
Usage Impact Factor [3], and the Y-Factor [1]. Figure 1
provides a general overview of the the various stages of the
MESUR project.

The MESUR project seeks to aggregate bibliographic, ci-

tation and usage data at a very large-scale and hence faces
signiﬁcant data management issues. Therefore, a primary
component of this project is focused on data acquisition,
de-duplication techniques, data quality measures, and miti-
gating the time and space limitations of modern triple store
platforms. The project includes eﬀorts to deﬁne provenance
XML schemas, algorithms for uncertainty quantiﬁcation,
and a novel semantic query model that leverages both rela-
tional and triple store databases. Another signiﬁcant com-
ponent of the MESUR project is the development of a schol-
arly ontology that represents bibliographic, citation, usage
concepts, along with concepts for expressing diﬀerent arti-
fact metrics.

The proposed poster is divided into two primary compo-
nents. The ﬁrst component will focus speciﬁcally on the
MESUR project’s data aggregation and processing method-
ology. This data ﬂow model is diagrammed in Figure 2.
The second component of the poster will present MESUR’s
scholarly OWL ontology [8]. The presentation of the ontol-
ogy will demonstrate the novel query model developed by
the MESUR project to handle the constraints of modern
triple store platforms.

2. CONCLUSION

The MESUR project aims to produce a variety of community-

accepted metrics of scholarly impact that each highlight dif-
ferent aspects of value in the scholarly community. This
model can be juxtaposed to the citation-driven monoculture
that presently prevails in the assessment of scholarly status.
Furthermore, the MESUR project aims to contribute to the
study of large-scale semantic networks. Along with novel
models of scholarly evaluation, advances in semantic net-
work analysis algorithms and large-scale data management
techniques have and will continue to be produced.
