ABSTRACT
Researchers of commercial search engines often collect data
using the application programming interface (API) or by
“scraping” results from the web user interface (WUI), but
anecdotal evidence suggests the interfaces produce diﬀerent
results. We provide the ﬁrst in-depth quantitative analysis
of the results produced by the Google, MSN and Yahoo API
and WUI interfaces. After submitting a variety of queries
to the interfaces for 5 months, we found signiﬁcant discrep-
ancies in several categories. Our ﬁndings suggest that the
API indexes are not older, but they are probably smaller
for Google and Yahoo. Researchers may use our ﬁndings to
better understand the diﬀerences between the interfaces and
choose the best API for their particular types of queries.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, Google, MSN and Yahoo have developed
freely available APIs for accessing their index, allowing re-
searchers to more easily automate the data collection process
and avoid breaking the stated policies of search engines that
prohibit automated queries against their WUIs. Unfortu-
nately, the APIs do not always give the same results as the
WUIs. The listserves and newsgroups that cater to the API
communities are full of questions regarding the perceived
diﬀerences in results between the two, and only one limited
study [4] we are aware of attempts to address the issue (only
for the Google API).

Since none of the search engines publicly disclose the in-
ner workings of their APIs, researchers are left wondering
if the APIs are giving second-rate data. For example, Bar-
Yossef and Gurevich [2] discount their ﬁndings, stating their

belief that the APIs are “served from older and smaller in-
dices than the indices used to serve human users.” Other
researchers appear to believe that the APIs serve the same
data as the WUIs [5]. The purpose of this study was to test
these assumptions.

2. EXPERIMENT

Every day for ﬁve months (late May to Oct 2006) we sub-

mitted four types of queries (3500 total) to each interface:

1. General search terms. We queried for the top 100
results and the total number of results using 50 popular
search terms1 and 50 computer science (CS) terms2.

2. URL backlinks. We queried for the number of back-

links to 100 randomly selected URLs.

3. Pages indexed for a website. We asked how many

pages were indexed for 100 randomly selected websites.

4. URL indexing and caching. We queried to see if

100 randomly selected URLs were indexed and/or cached.

We used three distance measures to compare the top search
results for our popular and CS terms: overlap P , Kendall
tau for top k lists K [3], and measure M [1]. Each mea-
sure was normalized so 1 meant complete agreement and 0
complete disagreement. P only penalizes for non-shared re-
sults, but K additionally penalizes for results that are out
of position. M penalizes changes in the top of the list more
heavily than changes at the bottom (since humans typically
examine the top results more often than the bottom ones).
We refer the reader to the cited works for formal deﬁnitions.
We initially compared WUI results from day n to day n−1
and API results from day n to day n − 1 and found a great
amount of ﬂuctuation. The interfaces tended to change at
the same rate each day for most terms, but we found several
popular term results like carmen electra and jessica simpson
that appeared to change at very diﬀerent rates in both of
Google’s interfaces. We did not observe this phenomena in
Yahoo and MSN. The K means of both interfaces for Google,
MSN and Yahoo were 0.94, 0.94 and 0.95, respectively.

Comparing the WUI and API results each day, we see a
great deal of variation (Figure 1)3. M appears signiﬁcantly
lower than the other measures when examining Google’s re-
sults for both popular and CS terms and for MSN popu-
lar terms, suggesting that Google’s and MSN’s top results
are the most signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between their interfaces.
Google’s distance measures are all signiﬁcantly higher for

CS terms than popular terms, but the reverse is true for
Yahoo (two-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.001).
These diﬀerences may be explained by how Google and Ya-
hoo treat web spam. Averaging the distance measures to-
gether, Google’s and Yahoo’s API results are 14% diﬀerent
than the WUI results, and MSN is 7% diﬀerent.

We tested to see if the API index was older (or newer)
than the WUI index by comparing API results from day
n to WUI results on day n ± 1, n ± 2, etc. For all three
search engines, we found the highest correlation on day n.
Therefore the API indexes are not older or newer.

We examined the number of times the interfaces produced
top k results that were identical in rank (K = 1) or in set
membership (P = 1). Google never produced identically
ranked top 100 results, and MSN and Yahoo did only slightly
better (0.2%). For top 10 results, MSN (38%) and Yahoo
(32%) improve considerably, but Google only slightly (4%).
There is only modest improvement of 3-6% by all of the
search engines when we disregard ranking.

When we examined the total results, backlinks and pages
indexed, we rarely saw exact agreement, so we examined
loose disagreements, when the API value is greater than or
less than ± 10% of the WUI value. We summarize our ﬁnd-
ings in Table 1. Responses to the URL indexing and caching
queries resulted in far more consistent interface responses for
all search engines; Google disagreed only 1.0% of the time,
MSN 1.1% and Yahoo 6.8%.

3. CONCLUSIONS

Researchers should expect that the results obtained through

any search engine’s API will rarely be identical to what the
general WUI user sees. This especially impacts applications
where recall is important. But some APIs perform better in
certain categories as we have summarized in Table 2. MSN
appears to have the most synchronized interfaces overall.

We have shown that all three search engines provide nearly
synchronized changes in their results each day, and the API
results are most similar to the WUI results on the same
day. Therefore we conclude that the APIs are not serving
from an older index. It is possible though that Google and
Yahoo are serving from a smaller index; both WUIs con-
sistently report total results that are higher than the APIs
(of course we cannot directly verify these estimates, and
Google adds ‘supplemental results’ to their WUI results).
Yahoo’s WUI consistently reports larger backlink counts,
and Google’s WUI consistently reports larger website page
counts. To give a more deﬁnitive answer, we suggest a fu-
ture experiment that randomly samples from each corpus
and compares the overlap [2].

On December 20, 2006, Google announced they were be-
ginning to deprecate their SOAP API in favor of an AJAX
API, a move which may require researchers to readopt old
screen-scraping methods. Despite this setback, it is our hope
that commercial search engines will make a committed eﬀort
to provide more synchronized interfaces for the academic
community in the future.
