ABSTRACT
PageRank is known to be an eﬃcient metric for computing
general document importance in the Web. While commonly
used as a one-size-ﬁts-all measure, the ability to produce
topically biased ranks has not yet been fully explored in de-
tail. In particular, it was still unclear to what granularity of
“topic” the computation of biased page ranks makes sense.
In this paper we present the results of a thorough quantita-
tive and qualitative analysis of biasing PageRank on Open
Directory categories. We show that the MAP quality of Bi-
ased PageRank generally increases with the ODP level up
to a certain point, thus sustaining the usage of more spe-
cialized categories to bias PageRank on, in order to improve
topic speciﬁc search.

INTRODUCTION

Full-text search is probably one of the most important fa-
cilities to access documents in the Web. Unlike controlled
collections such as digital libraries, the web does not have a
rich set of annotations. Consequently, when the user wants
to focus her query to a speciﬁc subject, she has to reformu-
late it with additional terms describing her topic of interest.
Yet this also implies that the set of possible results is re-
stricted to those documents which contain the given query
terms. If the user wants for example to ﬁnd “sales contact”
persons in the topic of “Business concerning natural textile
fabrics”, she has to express all this information as terms.
This query augmentation will clearly deprive her from ﬁnd-
ing most pages containing only the phrase “sales contact”
and the name of some textile company.

Since most queries submitted to web search engines con-
sist only of very few keywords, search results are suscepti-
ble to be implicitly biased towards generally popular web
sites. This is due to enriching text retrieval methods like
TFxIDF with link analysis algorithms as PageRank [4]. A
promising approach to solve this dilemma of under- and

over-speciﬁcation was to bias PageRank to favor a speciﬁc
set of pages, called biasing set [2]. In most cases these bi-
asing sets have been selected as subcategories of given large
scale taxonomies, such as the Open Directory (ODP)1.

Although there exist a few prior studies analyzing the
properties of such topically biased PageRank [1], many as-
pects remained unstudied.
In this paper we complete the
investigation. We perform a utility analysis for topically bi-
ased PageRank and clarify the relation between the param-
eters of an ODP category (e.g., depth, number of children
and siblings, number of pages therein, etc.) and the qual-
ity of the resulted biased rankings. We also investigate the
correlation between the biased ranking and the generic, non-
biased one. Finally, we sketch some applications of biased
PageRank which could beneﬁt from our study.
2. DEEPER INSIDE ODP

Setup. We empirically analyzed the quality of the ODP-
biased PageRank vectors2 using both quantitative measures,
i.e., Kendall Tau similarity [3], and qualitative ones, i.e.,
Mean Average Precision (MAP). Our testbed was a 9.3M
document web graph focused on the ODP catalog, which we
have recently gathered using the Heritrix3 crawler. About
100 biasing (sub-)categories were randomly chosen from four
top level categories, namely Business, Computers, Recre-
ation and Sports. This selection process was executed as
follows: For each of the four top categories, three subcat-
egories were randomly picked; then, for one of them, we
again randomly took three subcategories and so on, until
no deeper levels were available. Almost all paths ended at
level 6 (with level 1 being one of the ODP root categories).
Finally, we computed Biased PageRank vectors using the
pages residing in each of these categories as biasing sets.

We also selected ﬁve queries per category randomly us-
ing Google AdWords4, which suggests commonly used query
terms to some speciﬁc keywords of interest. Whenever such
a query resulted in less than one hundred results within
our index, we replaced it by another one, randomly selected
as well. Nevertheless, in most cases we obtained several
thousands of results per query. Note that these queries are
implicitly focused on each given ODP topic, and thus they
should have resulted in rather similar outputs for Nonbiased
and Biased PageRank.

zero values within its personalization vector [4].

and Biased PageRank for each associated category, as well
as its parent and each of its child categories. We also per-
formed unbiased searches (with regular PageRank) for each
query. In all cases, the output results were sorted by multi-
plying the Lucene5 TFxIDF score with the speciﬁc (Biased)
PageRank scores. For the quantitative analysis, the Top-30
matches from each result list were compared using Kendall
Tau, whereas for the qualitative one, we employed Mean Av-
erage Precision for the Top-10 results. Three persons eval-
uated all search results, rating them with 1 if they were
relevant both to the given query and category, and with 0
otherwise. The MAP scores for each (query, category) pair
were averaged over all subjects to obtain a single value per
pair. These were then further averaged over all queries, thus
calculating a MAP for each category, as used in Figure 1.

Results. In order to visualize the results we modeled the
categories as a directed hierarchical graph. Figure 1 presents
a fragment of that graph corresponding to the top category
/Business), which is representative for the remaining graph
as well. Nodes represent categories and edges between them
denote parent–child or child–parent relationships. An edge’s
width depicts the (averaged) Kendall similarity between the
two categories. The thicker it is, the more similar the linked
categories are. A node’s contour line width represents the
ratio between MAP for Biased PageRank and MAP for Non-
biased PageRank (marked as “NoBias”). Again, the thicker
this line is, the higher is the precision for Biased PageRank
when compared to NoBias6.

We now summarize our results as follows:
• There is no relationship between the Kendall similar-
ity of Biased and Unbiased PageRank (edge weights)
and the category level. Even though one would expect
lower categories to produce results more similar to each
other (as their biasing sets become rather small), this
phenomenon does not always occur. More, there are
higher level categories whose Biased PageRank vectors
are quite similar (e.g., Textiles / Textiles_And_Non-
wovens), although their biasing sets are larger.
• The size of the biasing set neither correlates with the
Kendall similarity, nor with the PageRank quality (in
terms of MAP). Large biasing sets may result in both
high and minimal improvements over non-biased Page-
Rank. We thus suspected that a higher correlation
might be achieved when comparing the connectivity
of the pages within each biasing set with MAP. How-
ever, if this connectivity is expressed in terms of total
amount of out-links, again no correlation occurs.
• The MAP ratings generally increase until ODP level
ﬁve, and then drop sharply. This shows that bottom
level ODP categories tend to be less useful biasing sets
as page amount and connectivity are rather low.
• MAP is not correlated with the Kendall similarity.
• Kendall similarity to Unbiased PageRank almost al-
ways tends to 0. This is quite important, as it shows
that biasing does have a signiﬁcant impact on ranking.
• Kendall similarities between parent and child categories
are generally very low (< 0.2). This indicates that it
would be useful to employ more specialized (deeper)

categories to bias PageRank on, rather than using the
top-level categories only.
• Kendall similarities between sibling categories are gen-
erally very low (< 0.2; see the upper right part of the
ﬁgure for an excerpt of such similarities). Thus, ODP
sibling categories are well deﬁned, being quite distinct
from each other.

Practical Applications.

It is important to note that
biasing PageRank using ODP is highly useful in many ap-
plications. To name but a few, it can be employed for (1)
Personalized Web Search (i.e., bias on user’s topics of inter-
est), (2) Faceted Seach (i.e., promote the selected facet by
biasing), (3) Automatic Extension of the ODP (i.e., derive
new qualitative pages to add into each category), etc.
3. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK
In this paper we analyzed the quality of Biased PageRank
under diﬀerent categories of the Open Directory taxonomy.
We showed that the MAP quality of Biased PageRank gener-
ally increases with the ODP level, yet it also starts dropping
sharply at some point, when the amount and connectivity
of the pages contained within that category level are too
low. Moreover, we showed that biasing on diﬀerent siblings,
or on children of a given category would in general result
in quite diﬀerent outputs, thus sustaining the usage of more
specialized (deeper) categories to bias PageRank on in order
to obtain a better search outcome.

As computing Biased PageRank for all ODP categories is
still rather time consuming, we intend to devise algorithms
based upon these ﬁndings to automatically select only those
categories which yield search results very diﬀerent from reg-
ular PageRank, while also signiﬁcantly improving its quality.
