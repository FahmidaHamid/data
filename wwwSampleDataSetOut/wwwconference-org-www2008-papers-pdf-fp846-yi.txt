ABSTRACT
In this paper we study the characteristics of search queries
submitted from mobile devices using various Yahoo! one-
Search applications during a 2 months period in the second
half of 2007, and report the query patterns derived from 20
million English sample queries submitted by users in US,
Canada, Europe, and Asia. We examine the query distri-
bution and topical categories the queries belong to in order
to ﬁnd new trends. We compare and contrast the search
patterns between US vs international queries, and between
queries from various search interfaces (XHTML/WAP, java
widgets, and SMS). We also compare our results with pre-
vious studies wherever possible, either to conﬁrm previous
ﬁndings, or to ﬁnd interesting diﬀerences in the query dis-
tribution and pattern.

INTRODUCTION

The number of wireless subscribers is growing rapidly,
from under 200 million in June 2005 to over 243 million
in June 2007 in the US, a growth rate of almost 2 million
users per month1. The world-wide growth is projected to
be at an even more impressive rate: over 4 billion by 2010
from 2.7 billion at the end of 2006.

With the growing population of mobile subscribers, it is
anticipated that the access to the internet through their
wireless devices is to grow, too.
In fact, we might have
already entered into the early stage of the massive adop-
tion of internet access through wireless handheld devices.
The use of popular internet applications, including email
and maps, has been growing at a very high rate lately.2
Further, in most emerging markets, like India and Eastern
European countries, majority of users are projected to start
experiencing the internet through their mobile devices than
through desktop computers3. There is tremendous market
opportunity on wireless services, especially for advertising
businesses, as wireless device becomes the third screen af-
ter TV and computer monitors. Mobile search may play a
major role in facilitating and accelerating the internet data
access through mobile devices, just as the majority of inter-
net users use a desktop search application as a gateway to
the internet services.

It is a paramount importance to understand users’ infor-
mation needs and demands for mobile data access in order
to better serve them. And it would be very helpful to un-
derstand the usage patterns and the user intent of search
queries to learn their wireless information needs and to de-
cipher the trends.

We have studied Yahoo! mobile search query log data.
Yahoo! oneSearch4 is a mobile search service with three
distinct search application interfaces built on top of it: a
XHTML/WAP browser interface (http://m.yahoo.com), a
java application interface (Yahoo! Go), and an SMS text
messaging interface (Yahoo! Mobile SMS).

The goal of this study is two-fold:
• to explore the search characteristics of the sample data

and to discover notable patterns in the queries

• to supplement and complement prior studies on mobile
query pattern analysis by relaxing various restrictions
put on the previous studies and by exploring a new set
of data

We intended to primarily focus our analysis on areas where
prior work is not available, or has not explored comprehen-
sively. The followings are the major focus areas of our study:
• comparison of underlying query distribution and char-

acteristics to ﬁnd new trends

patterns

• analysis of mobile queries from various types of mobile

application interfaces

The data set for our analysis consists of a random sample
of 20 million queries submitted from US, Europe, and Asia
through Yahoo! mobile search during a 2 months period
in 2007. Only English queries were included in the study
in order to eliminate language speciﬁc idiosyncrasy and to
maintain consistency in the analysis. The cross comparison
of the query patterns among various language and culture
is beyond the scope of this paper. All of the sample data
is completely anonymous. No data to match a user’s iden-
tity is maintained or used in our study, and we report only
aggregate statistics.

For the study, we ﬁrst surveyed empirical observations
drawn from the sample data sets. We apply ﬁrst-order anal-
ysis on the sample queries and examine the statistics such
as the length of an individual query, the number of words
per query, and the query distribution and repetition pattern.
We have conducted research on the topical categories and
application speciﬁc query patterns.

Major contributions of this paper include the followings:
• It is by far the largest scale mobile query log analysis
for English queries. It is more than an order of magni-
tude larger than the previous studies on mobile query
data[10, 9].

• It reports inter-regional and inter-national mobile search
patterns in large scale including the US, Europe, and
Asian countries.

• It includes the results of comprehensive analysis of var-

ious types of mobile application interfaces.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next
section, we brieﬂy introduce Yahoo’s mobile search services
and applications. Section 3 describes the sample data sets
used for the study. Section 4, the main section of this paper,
consists of three major parts: section 4.1 is for the ﬁrst-order
analysis and the results, section 4.2 for the mobile query
categorization and the results, and section 4.3 for mobile
search application speciﬁc issues. We provide an overview of

Figure 2: Yahoo! oneSearch Front Page Interface

related work and the comparison with our work in section 5,
and conclude in section 6 with discussion and plan for the
future work.

2. YAHOO! MOBILE SEARCH SERVICE

AND INTERFACES

Yahoo! oneSearch is a federated search service optimized
for mobile devices and users. For a given user query, it, ﬁrst,
analyses the concept and the intent of the query. Second, it
produces and executes a search execution plan, optimized for
the concept- and intent- of the query, against a large array of
vertical back-end including the Web, news, images, ﬁnance
information, Wikipedia, user-generated contents such as Ya-
hoo! Answers, and so on. Lastly, it aggregates the search
results of the verticals and blends the results in a manner
optimal to the query, and to the rendering on the mobile
device.

The goal of Yahoo! oneSearch is to provide better search
results and user experience by providing immediate answers
to user queries, not just links to the target pages, and by
minimizing the number of clicks for search and browsing in-
teractions in order to minimize the number of round trip
requests to the servers over the slow wireless data network.
The search results of vertical back-ends are grouped by ver-
ticals and blended for optimal user experience by taking
account of various factors, including the concept and the
intent of the query, the content relevance and rank of the
search results, and other query independent factors, such as
mobile device types. See Figure 1 for a few samples of the
search results.

Yahoo! oneSearch servers process all mobile search queries
coming from 3 diﬀerent Yahoo! search interfaces for mobile
devices: an XHTML/WAP browser interface, a java appli-
cation interface for Yahoo! Go, and an SMS text messaging
interface for Yahoo! Mobile SMS. The rest of this section
provides a brief introduction to the three Yahoo! mobile
search product oﬀerings.
2.1 Yahoo! oneSearch XHTML/WAP Inter-

face

Figure 2 shows oneSearch XHTML/WAP front page in-
terface available at http://m.yahoo.com. The page has a

search box and a list of links to various mobile applications
such as email and calendar, and links to other verticals such
as news, ﬁnance, and ﬂickr.

The most distinctive feature of Yahoo! oneSearch SERP
(Search Engine Results Page) is the grouping of the search
results by the source verticals of the results. Currently, ﬁrst,
the federated search results are blended and ranked in an
optimal ordering of the verticals. Result pages of a verti-
cal source is ranked optimally within the vertical. Figure 1
shows search results of a few sample queries
2.2 Yahoo! Go for Mobile

Yahoo! Go (downloadable from http://m.yahoo.com) is
a broad array of customizable mobile oﬀerings under a sin-
gle downloadable java-based application, optimized for the
small screen of a mobile phone. At the core of the in-
terface is the carousel users can scroll through, compris-
ing currently nine widgets including the made-for-mobile
Yahoo! oneSearch as well as other popular mobile appli-
cations, such as email, local info and maps, news, sports,
ﬁnance, entertainment, weather, and Flickr photos.

With the advanced caching and background loading tech-
nology, Yahoo! Go widget content is automatically and con-
tinuously pushed to the user’s phone, so it is readily available
when it is needed.
2.3 Yahoo! SMS Search

The SMS Search application provides an interface that
a search query is submitted by an SMS text messaging. A
SMS text message with the search query is sent to the server
(ex. short code: 92466 for the US), and the result is deliv-
ered by one or more text messages. Each result message may
contain the search results directly, instead of search result
page links, at least for certain types of information (such
as business listings), thus minimizing the need of additional
click. This is a very useful service for users whose device is
not equipped with data access capability.

3. SAMPLE DATA SET

We use two query samples from Yahoo! mobile query logs

during the period of August and September 2007:

1. US sample queries: 20 million page views with non-
empty US English queries were randomly selected, with
10 million samples each from August and September,
respectively.

2. International sample queries: 20 million page views
with non-empty English queries during the same pe-
riod were randomly sampled in the same manner. This
query data set consists of queries from Australia, Canada,
India, New Zealand, and the UK.

Both are limited to English queries only. The countries se-
lected for the study are those in Asia, Europe, and North
America that Yahoo! receives English queries predominantly
from.

4. ANALYSIS OF MOBILE QUERIES

In this section, we present the results of various analyses
on mobile queries. Section 4.1 reports the results of various
ﬁrst-order analysis applied on individual queries from the
sample data sets. Section 4.2 describes the mobile query

categorization. We discuss mobile search platform speciﬁc
issues in section 4.3.
4.1 First-Order Analysis of Mobile Queries

We begin the mobile query analysis by considering indi-
vidual queries. We ﬁrst examine the quantitative statistics
of unique queries. Then, we discuss the mobile query distri-
bution patterns derived from the query repetition pattern.

4.1.1 Unique Queries
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the sample queries

and unique queries derived from the sample data sets. For
the sample queries examined in this study, there are roughly
4.49M unique queries in the US data set, and 3.7M in the
international data set. On average, a query is repeated 4.46
and 5.41 times during the 2 months test period in the US
and the international data set, respectively; on average, over
20% more repetition of a query in the international data set.
The average number of words per query is 2.35 (mean, 2;
std. dev: 1.16; max., 65) for the US queries, and 2.1 (mean,
2; std. dev, 1.09; max 60) for international queries. The
average number of characters per query is 13.73 (mean, 13;
std. dev, 7.13; max, 263) and 13.6 (mean, 13; std. dev, 6.8;
max 501) for the US and international queries, respectively.
US users are using about 11% more number of words than
the international users for almost the same length of a query.
We plan to investigate if there is any underlying diﬀerence
in the query pattern between the two groups that causes
this diﬀerence, such as more adoption of abbreviated terms
by the US users.

When only unique queries are considered (i.e., with no
weight by their repetition), the average numbers increase
quite substantially. The average number of words per unique
query is 3.05 (mean, 3; std. dev: 1.41) and 2.54 (mean, 2;
std. dev, 1.3) for the US and international samples, respec-
tively. The average number of characters per unique query

Figure 5: Cumulative Query Frequency of Top 2K

Data Sets

Figure 4: Distribution of character lengths per
query - US vs.
International for unique and all
queries

is 18.48 (mean, 17; std. dev, 7.92) and 17.5 (mean, 13; std.
dev, 9.13) for the US and international queries, respectively.
The increased lengths on the unique queries imply that many
head queries (queries with high frequency of repetitions) are
shorter than average, and longer queries lie on tail queries
(queries with very small number of repetitions).

The distribution of the number of words per query is plot-
ted in Figure 3. It compares US and International queries for
unique queries and all queries. Figure 4 is for the distribu-
tion of the number of characters per query. We ﬁnd notable
diﬀerences in the distribution of the number of words (Fig-
ure 3) between our results and [9]: the most frequent query
word length in [9] is 1, while ours is 2.

Figure 5 illustrates the cumulative query frequency of top
2000 unique US and International queries. The lower graph
is for International queries and the upper one is for US.
The top 2K most frequent queries, or less than 0.05% of
the unique queries in the US, account for over 27% of the
entire query volume in the US, while the same number of
top queries (less than 0.06%) are responsible for 17% of
the international query volume.
In the cumulative graph,
the lower the volume accounted for by the top-N unique

Figure 6: Cumulative Query Frequency of Top 1K
Queries of US, CA, UK, IN, AU-NZ (in the order
the corresponding curve appear on the graph from top
to bottom)

queries, the more diverse the set of queries received. There-
fore, this indicates that the US queries have less variety,
even with more number of unique queries. In other words,
a much smaller percentage of US head queries are much
more frequently asked, thus accounting for a larger portion
of the entire query volume. This is also explained by the
fact that the international data set has much less number of
tail queries than the US data set even with the diverse user
base. (And this can be veriﬁed in the international query
repetition graph, Figure 8, discussed in the next section.)

Figure 6 compares the cumulative coverage of 5 countries
- US, Canada, UK, India, and AU-NZ (Australia and New
Zealand combined) - for top 1000 queries from 1M randomly
sampled unique queries for each country. The volume cov-
erage of the 0.1% of unique queries varies from 32% (AU-
NZ) to 61% (US). The graph indicates that AU-NZ queries
are most diverse followed by India, UK, Canada, and US
queries. US queries are still the least diverse, and Canada
search pattern is a close mirror in terms of the frequency
pattern of the head queries.

Comparison with Prior Studies:.

Our query word count (avg. 2.35 words per query) stays in
the range of the corresponding ﬁgures reported in [10] (avg.

USCAUKINAU-NZ2.56) and [9] (avg, 2.3). Since [9] excludes PDA queries
that are typically longer (avg. 2.7) from the calculation,
their number is like a lower bound of the size of mobile
queries. Our query word count (avg. 2.35) is consistent
with the corresponding numbers, 2.29 on average, reported
in [1], that combined PDA queries as we did, although it is
not directly comparable because their study is on Japanese
queries.

For the number of characters, our queries are much shorter
with 13.73 characters per word on average, than [9] (15.5 in
XHTML, 17.5 for PDAs) and [10] (avg 16.8).

It is interesting that most of the top-level ﬁrst order statis-
tic quite agree each other between the other studies and ours,
even with the language diﬀerence. Average number of words
in a query is 2.29, 2.3, 2.35 and 2.56, for [1], [9], ours, and
[10], respectively, though the number of characters per query
is drastically lower in Japanese queries at 7.9 vs. 16.8 in [10]
due to the language diﬀerence. Further, this is highly con-
sistent with average number of query terms in web search
reported in [7] and [14], 2.35 on average, though it is quite
old data for the Web’s standard, regarding the fast evolving
nature of the Web.

This may indicate that mobile users repeat some of their
search habits from desktop search on mobile search. And
this may also suggest that about less than 2.5 words are
enough for users to ﬁnd the information of their need, mak-
ing the number of search terms indeed a "ground truth" of
web search, as suggested in [9].

4.1.2 Analysis of Query Duplicates
Another interesting question about query strings is how
often a query is repeated. As in desktop web search[14], our
earlier observation (Figure 5) indicates that a small set of
queries are repeated many times.

We have analyzed the query duplication pattern in the
sample queries in terms of the number of query repetitions
and the number of corresponding queries. The pattern fol-
lows the power law distribution, exhibiting a remarkably
linear pattern on a log-log plot, as showen in Figure 7 and
Figure 8. The x-axis of the graph represents the log of the
number of query repetitions, and y-axis the log of the num-
ber of corresponding queries. The slopes of the regression
line of the plots for US and international queries are -1.25
and -1.44, respectively.

The slight downward tilt on the upper left end of the
international query distribution graph (See Figure 8) indi-
cates that the international data set has much less number
of tail queries (queries asked only less than a few times).
In the international query data, there are 1,611,322 unique
queries that were asked only once, which is about 49% of the
number of entire unique queries, and about 8% of the en-
tire sample query volume, while there are 2,669,290 unique
queries in the US query data with frequency 1; which corre-
sponds to 66% of the unique queries and about 13% of the
entire sample query volume. The amount of unique queries
with frequency count 1 corresponds to the y-intercept of the
query distribution graph.

The most frequent query in the international data set ap-
pears over 58K times (or 0.29% of the entire sample query
volume), while in the US data set, the most frequent query
was appeared over 88K times (or 0.44% of the sample query
volume).

4.2 Mobile Query Categorization

Both US and international queries are automatically clas-
siﬁed into the topical categories and the categorization result
is summarized in Table 2 and 3. For the query categoriza-
tion for this study, we have used an open source logistic
regression based classiﬁer5. Refer [12] for the detailed algo-
rithm. We have used US English Web search queries for the
training of the classiﬁer. For the classiﬁcation taxonomy, we
have used an in-house taxonomy with total 821 nodes with
maximum depth 6. There are 23 top-level categories, 152
second, 281 third, 229 fourth, 94 ﬁfth, and 41 sixth level
categories. See table 2 for the list of top level categories.

To our knowledge, automatic query categorization by a
machine learning algorithm is in its infancy and it is a highly
diﬃcult problem. Not only are the search queries typically
short and ambiguous, but they also lack context. This makes
query categorization a much more diﬃcult problem than
page content classiﬁcation. In addition, due to the diﬃcul-
ties of mobile device input user interface, the mobile queries

suﬀer from a higher rate of spelling error. One notable point
in the overall categorization results is that the percentages
of uncategorized queries are high. This might be due to the
fact that many uncategorized queries are too short. Notice
that the average number of words and characters per query
for uncategorized queries are only 47% (US unique queries)
and 67% (international unique queries) of that of the entire
query sample. With much less information from the query
and lack of context, the classiﬁer might have not been able to
perform as well on those queries. Another notable diﬀerence
in the query classiﬁcation results is much higher percentage
of the uncategorized queries in the international samples: 9
(for unique queries) and 12% (for all queries) for US sample
data vs. 28% for the international sample data. The fact
that we have used US Web search queries to train the clas-
siﬁer may explain the underperformance of the classiﬁer on
the international queries.

Table 2 and 3 list the top-level categories and the percent-
age of the queries, the average number of words per query,
and average characters per query for the US query sam-
ples and international query samples, respectively. Other
than uncategorized queries, there is no statistically signiﬁ-
cant variations between the categories in terms of average
words and characters per query.

The most popular category was the entertainment cate-
gory. Table 4 lists popular sub-categories of entertainment
queries. The entertainment category itself is a broad cat-
egory with multiple sub-types of queries, such as queries
related to music, movies, games, TV, amusement, adult and
romance, radio, performance, etc. We anticipate that the
entertainment category is substantially more sizable as a
percentage of overall queries relative to the ﬁndings in [10].
This is in part due to the fact that in this analysis adult-
related queries, which in previous studies have represented
a fairly sizable percentage of overall queries, were evaluated
in the entertainment category. In addition to the two con-
jectures given in [10], the reason why adult-related queries
are so high on mobile search may be because image-related
search queries are included in the overall analysis due to
the nature of Yahoo! oneSearch’s federated search model.
Kamvar and Baluja has observed that their volume of adult
queries has been increased from over 20% to over 25% after
launching a new transcoder that retains more images than
the earlier version of transcoder that eliminated most images
on the search results pages [10].

We also notice that most of the top level categories other
than entertainment, people, retail, sports, technology, and
travel categories, represent only a small percentage (<=2%)
of the US query volume. A similar pattern holds true for
the international queries. This skewness in the topical inter-
est may change over time as the mobile search usage grows.
Wireless search is still in a very early stage relative to desk-
top search. It may follow the pattern of Web search in the
early days where head queries represented a relatively high
proportion of overall queries. If mobile search is following
the path Web search has taken, we would expect that that
the tail of search queries would lengthen over time, and we
would anticipate the category percentages including enter-
tainment queries, would change. Spink et. al. reported that
there had been substantial changes in the Web search query

distribution between 1997 and 2001 [15]. Entertainment
queries decreased from 19.9% to 6.6%, and adult queries
from 16.8% to 8.5%, while commerce, travel, employment or
economy queries combined increased from 12.5% to 24.7%,
and people, place, and things combined from 6.7% to 19.7%.
In addition to the topical categorization, there are a few
notable query types or intent. First, there are queries with
local intent that intend to search for local information. This
is not necessarily a topical category, but rather a meta cat-
egory that can be combined potentially with any topical
search. The local search intention might not be always ex-
plicit with the location information given with the query,
such as a zip code or a city name. We estimate about 9-10%
of our queries has local intention.

Another notable type is navigational queries. We have
found about 5% of our queries being URL (or navigational)
queries which is much lower than the result reported by [9]
at 17%. There, also, are queries searching for mobile spe-
ciﬁc products and services, such as mobile games, ringtones,
wallpapers, email services, etc.

Figure 9 illustrates query categorization pattern of unique
queries between the US and international queries. The graph
shows there is no major diﬀerence in terms of the topical in-
terest of queries of the users of the two groups, except the
’travel’ and ’uncategorized’ class.
In fact, the same kind
of graph for all queries shows very similar pattern between
the two data sets, and thus is omitted from the paper for
brevity. Please note that this does not mean that the actual
queries are quite identical. Rather it means that the types
of queries are quite similar. For example, individual queries
asked by the US users that belong to sports may quite dif-
ferent from sports queries asked by the international users.
Therefore, there could be subcategories that show mean-
ingful diﬀerences between the two groups. We avoid the
detailed discussion due to the lack of space.

4.3 Application-Speciﬁc Query Patterns

In this section, we examine distinct search behaviors of
users using various types of search application interfaces.
As discussed earlier, Yahoo! mobile search oﬀers three dis-
tinctive mobile search application platforms: a widget-based
Yahoo! Go, a browser based Yahoo! oneSearch interface,
and an SMS text message interface. Since each platform re-
quires diﬀerent level of device sophistication and the commu-
nication medium, we initially hypothesized each user group
may possess diﬀerent demographic variations as well as de-
vice capability, and therefore diﬀerent search interests.

We have separated the US query sample data set into
three, each containing queries only from the corresponding
search platform: US_SMS for Yahoo! Mobile SMS, US_YGO
for Yahoo! Go, and US_WAP for the browser based Yaoo!
one-Search queries. The classiﬁcation result is listed on
table 5 and plotted on Figure 10.

As shown on the graph, each user interface exhibits quite
distinctive patterns in the entertainment category. For ex-
ample, US_SMS queries has only 14% entertainment queries,
while US_WAP has 55%. One possible explanation for the
variance is that it may be due to the user interface, since
SMS search results cannot include images. As a result, other
categories for which SMS may be well suited, such as Sports,
occupy a much higher percentage of queries.

Another potentially interesting pattern shown on Table 5
is the increase of Sports and Travel categories in US_YGO.
One possible explanation of this may be due to the availabil-
ity of services in the Yahoo! Go product such as Sports and
Maps, which may encourage users to search for those related
topics more frequently. Table 6 and 7 list the sub-categories
of sports and travel and the US_YGO and US_SMS query
distribution.

Other potentially interesting pattern shown on the table 5
is the increase of leisure oriented searches, such as sports and
travel, for both US_YGO and US_SMS. Table 6 and 7 list
the subcategories of sports and travel and the US_YGO and
US_SMS query distribution on them.
5. RELATED WORK

Search engine query log data is an invaluable source of
information for understanding user intention and the char-
acteristics of user queries, as well as for measuring search
results relevance. Accordingly query logs have been widely
explored for various purposes, including proﬁling of search
query characteristics ([14, 7, 15] for the desktop web search,
and [1, 9, 10, 4] for mobile search). Another related and
interesting problem of identifying user goals and intent of
a query using query log data is discussed in [13, 11, 6]. [2,
13] have manually classiﬁed query log data to capture user
needs behind the search. In addition, [16] and [5] have used
query logs for topic identiﬁcation and result clustering, and
for better snippet generation, respectively.

There have been several large scale studies in the near
past on mobile query log analysis for deciphering mobile
search query patterns, including [1], [9], and [10]. Kamvar
and Baluja reports the study conducted using 1 million ran-
domly sampled Google mobile query log data for a month
period of 2005 [9]. It is the ﬁrst large scale mobile query log
analysis we are aware of, that provides a large number of
quantitative statistics on wireless search performed on cell
phones and PDAs. They report a large amount of ﬁrst-
order statistics on search terms and the topics of the search
queries that provide insight on how and what the mobile
users are searching for. In their follow-up study [10] using 1

million page-view randomly sampled from Google’s logs in
early 2007 conﬁrms some of the ﬁndings in their previous
study, and ﬁnds some diﬀerences and changes during the
period that provides a very useful insight about how mobile
search is evolving. Some of their ﬁndings include the search
terms in 2007 study are more diverse (i.e. less homogeneous
queries), more high-end device, and more adult queries.

Another large-scale mobile query log analysis was by Baeza-
Yates, Dupret and Velasco on Yahoo! Japan’s search logs.
Their ﬁndings include results consistent with US mobile
search results, such as average number of terms per query,
even with the drastic diﬀerences in language, with some re-
sults that are drastically diﬀerent. For example, average
number of characters per query is only half as much as other
US queries.

Silverstein et al. conducted a very large scale query log
analysis and reported many interesting aspects of web search
[14]. Though we can not draw any conclusion for mobile
search directly from the web log analysis results, they will
continue being an invaluable reference information for com-
parison and giving us insight on how the mobile web search
might evolve in the near future.
It will be interesting to
ﬁnd out if the mobile web and the search would follow the
footprint and growth of the web, or it’ll branch out towards
a totally diﬀerent path.

Some other work on mobile query log analysis includes
[3, 8] that address better information display mechanism for
mobile devices.
6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

The goal of this mobile query analysis study is to provide
quantitative statistics on various aspects of mobile search
that can help us to gain better insight on the mobile users’
information needs, and to better understand how they are
fulﬁlling their needs by mobile search. Although some of the
previous studies have already provided with very insightful
data on some of the mobile search characteristics, albeit with
restrictions and limitations, we ﬁnd there are many more
aspects and issues the previous studies have not addressed
upon.

We have conducted a large-scale study on English mobile
queries from the US, Europe, and Asia. We have analyzed
various top-level statistics on individual queries, and their
repetition patterns to identify query distribution and quanti-
tative patterns. We have automatically classiﬁed the sample
queries into a topical categories in order to capture the ar-
eas of user interest. We have compared the results with the
previous studies, between inter-regional and inter-national
groups, and between the user groups of various search ap-
plications. The following is a few interesting points and
trends from the results:

• Personal entertainment is the most popular queries:
As expected, users are searching for personal enter-
tainment. The entertainment category is a broad cate-
gory with multiple sub-types of queries, such as music,
movies, games, TV, amusement, adult and romance,
radio, performace, etc.

• Mobile query pattern is still dynamic: Based on the
diﬀerences observed among various studies, in terms
of query distribution, we believe mobile users are still
ﬁguring out ways they can utilize the new device and
services, and their usage pattern is still evolving.

• Regional patterns: There exist meaningful variations
in the regional query pattern in terms of the quanti-
tative statistics. US users use longer and more word
queries than international users. There are more tail
queries in the US data set. And queries from the US
users are still the most homogeneous among the coun-
tries studied, followed by Canada, UK, India, Australiz-
New Zealand. However, they show very similar topical
interests, at least at the top level.

• Application-depedent patterns: We have found inter-
esting diﬀerences among users of various search ap-
plications in terms of their topical interests of their
queries. We conjecture some variations are due to the
diﬀerent capacity of their mobile devices, while some
originate from the demographic diﬀerences from the
groups of users. In this study, we have not attempted
to perform any analysis on the demographic variations,
however, and further discussion is beyond the scope of
this study.

In the future, we plan to study click-through data to bet-
ter understand the impact of search results grouping and to
come up with better results blending algorithm. We also
like to improve query concept identiﬁcation and to conduct
research on user query intent analysis.

Finally, with the recent launch of unstructured voice input
in Yahoo! oneSearch, we plan to study how spoken queries
may diﬀer from typed queries.
