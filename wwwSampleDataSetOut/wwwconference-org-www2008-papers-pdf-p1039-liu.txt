ABSTRACT 
Combating  Web  spam  has  become  one  of  the  top  challenges  for 
Web search engines. State-of-the-art spam detection techniques are 
usually  designed  for  specific  known  types  of  Web  spam  and  are 
incapable  and  inefficient  for  recently-appeared  spam.  With  user 
behavior analyses into Web access logs, we propose a spam page 
detection  algorithm  based  on  Bayes 
learning.  Preliminary 
experiments  on  Web  access  data  collected  by  a  commercial  Web 
site (containing over 2.74 billion user clicks in 2 months) show the 
effectiveness of the proposed detection framework and algorithm.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
With  the  explosive  growth  of  information  on  the  Web,  search 
engines become more and more important  in  people’s  daily  lives. 
According to [1], most search users only view the first few URLs in 
result  lists,  so  internet  service  providers  want  their  pages  to  be 
ranked as high as possible by search engines to capture more user 
attention.  Web  spam  can  be  defined  as  any  attempt  to  get  “an 
unjustifiably favorable relevance or importance score for some Web 
page,  considering  the  page’s  true  value”  [2].  Because  Web  spam 
leads  to  obstacles  to  users’  information  acquisition  process,  spam 
detection is treated as a major challenge for search engines.  

Currently, anti-spam techniques usually make use of Web page’s 
content  [3]  or  hyper-link  features  [4]  to  construct  classifier  and 
identify spam pages. After a certain kind of Web spam appears in 
search  result  lists,  engineers  examine  the  characteristics  of  this 
spam type and design the specific strategies to identify it. However, 
once a kind of spam is detected and banned, the spammers will turn 
to develop new Web spam instantly. With this method,  anti-spam 
techniques can only identify Web spam which has already caused 
severe loss and drawn search engineers’ attention.  

In contrast to the prevailing approaches, we propose a different 
anti-spam framework in which spam sites are identified because of 
their  deceitful  motivation  instead  of  their  content/hyper-link 
appearance.  We  introduce  three  features  developed  from  user 
behavior pattern analyses and design a learning-based approach to 
combine these behavior features to identify Web spam pages.  
2.  USER-BASED SPAM DETECTION 
In  order  to  analyze  into  the  behavior  pattern  of  Web  users,  we 
collected Web access log from July 1st, 2007 to August 26th, 2007

of  Sohu.com 

with 
toolbars 
(http://tb.sogou.com/).  No  private  information  is  included  in  these 
access logs but user sessions can be identified by different session 
IDs.  Source  and  Destination  URLs  of  user  clicks  and  user’s  stay 
time  in  a  certain  page  are  also  recorded.  The  access  log  contains 
over  2.74  billion  user  clicks  on  800  million  Web  pages  and  22.1 
million user sessions during 57 days. 1 

We also construct Web spam training and test sets to verify the 
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. During the time period in 
which the access log was collected, we had three assessors examine 
the search result lists of the 1000 most frequently asked queries in 
Sogou search engine (http://www.sogou.com/). By this means, 802 
spam sites were identified and used in feature selection process as 
training set. A different set of 1149 Web sites were random selected 
from  the  sites  whose  access  behavior  was  recorded.  These  sites 
were annotated as spam or not and used for performance evaluation.  
2.1  User Behavior Feature of Web Spam Page 
Based on analysis into the different user behavior patterns between 
Web spam pages and ordinary pages, we propose three features to 
identify spam pages.  

Firstly,  spam  pages  try  to  attract  Web  user’s  attention  but  its 
content is not as valuable as it appears. Therefore, Web spam page 
receives  most  of  its  user  visiting  from  search  engines  instead  of 
from  non-spam  pages  or  bookmark  lists.  We  define  the  Search 
Engine Oriented Visiting rate (SEOV rate) of a certain page p as:  

SEOV

p
)(

=

(#

Search

engine

oriented
pof
)

(#

Visits

visits

pof

)

 

(1) 

It  is  seldom  for  Web  spam  pages  to  be  visited  except  through 
search  result  lists;  but  ordinary  pages  may  be  visited  by  other 
means. Therefore, the SEOV values of Web spam pages should be 
higher than ordinary pages.  

Secondly, user attention is one of  the  most  important  resources 
for WWW information providers. Ordinary Web site owners always 
want  to  keep  users  navigating  in  their  sites  as  long  as  possible. 
However,  spammers’  major  purpose  to  construct  spam  sites  is  to 
guide users to advertisements or services they wouldn’t like to see.  
Therefore,  most  Web  users  tend  to  end  their  navigation  in  spam 
sites as soon as they noticed the spamming activities.  

We  can  define  two  behavior  features  to  describe  this  different 
user  visiting  pattern  between  ordinary  and  spam  pages.  The  Start 
Point Visiting rate (SP rate) feature describes how many clicks are 
performed on a certain page p and it can be defined as:  
   (2)

The Short-term Navigation rate (SN rate) shows how many pages 

of a site s will be visited once user visit s and can be defined as:

we examine the top-ranked Web pages in the spam-possibility list 
given by our algorithm and analyze their spamming techniques. 

In  order  to  validate  the  effectiveness  of  the  three  proposed 
features,  we  compared  the  differences  in  feature  distribution 
between ordinary page and spam pages. For instance, statistic of the 
SEOV feature is shown in Figure 1.

SEOV

 
Figure  1.  Search  Engine  Oriented  Visiting  (SEOV)  rate 
distribution of ordinary and Web spam pages.  

In Figure 1, over 80% ordinary pages get less than 10% of their 
visiting  from  search  engines;  while  almost  50%  Web  spam  pages 
receive  over  half  of  their  navigation  from  search  result  lists. 
Therefore, we can see that most Web spam pages’ SEOV value is 
higher  than  ordinary  pages  because  search  engine  is  the  target  of 
Web spamming and sometimes the only way in which spam can be 
visited. The SP and SN features can also separate Web spam from 
ordinary  pages.  According  to  our  statistics,  for  48%  spam  pages, 
almost none (less than 5%) users click any hyperlink on them (SP < 
0.05); while 63% ordinary Web pages receive clicks from over 30% 
of  their  readers  (SP  >  0.3).    For  the  SN  feature  with  N=3,  53% 
ordinary pages have almost none (less than 10%) short navigations 
(SN < 0.1); meanwhile 96% Web spam’s SN value is over 0.6.  
2.2  Learning-based Spam Detection Algorithm 
User-behavior  features  mentioned  in  Section  2.1  can  be  used  to 
identify Web spam pages. In order to combine these features, we try 
to  use  naïve  Bayes  learning  method  which  is  believed  to  be  both 
effective and efficient for low dimensional instance spaces.

information  from 

   With  Bayes  assumption  and  features’  independent  assumption, 
the  probability  of  a  Web  page  being  a  Web  spam  page  can  be 
calculated  with 
the  Web  corpus  and 
its 
corresponding spam page sample set according to Equation (4). 
3.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
We choose ROC curves and corresponding AUC values to evaluate 
the  performance  of  our  spam  detection  algorithm  because  it  is  a 
useful  technique  for  organizing  classifiers  and  visualizing  their 
performance.  

In Figure 1, SP and SEOV are more effective than the SN feature 
in  detecting  Web  spam.  It  also  shows  that  the  proposed  learning 
algorithm gains better performance than any of the three features. 
The  AUC  value  for  the  algorithm’s  ROC  curve  is  0.7926,  which 
means our detection algorithm has 79.26% chances to rank a Web 
spam higher than a non-spam in its spam-possibility result list.  

In practical search applications we care more about whether the 
detected possible spam pages are really Web spam pages. Therefore,

combine SEOV, SP and SN features, compared with the curves 
on test sets using a certain user-behavior feature only.  

Experimental results in Table 1 show that only a few (5.98%) of 
the  top-ranked  pages  are  mis-identified.  Analysis  into  these  non-
spam pages shows that they are mostly low-quality pages that adopt 
some kind of SEO techniques to attract users. Reducing them will 
not cause major loss for most Web users.

Pages that cannot be accessed 

In the top-ranked Web pages of our possible spam list, there are 
also  a  number  of  pages  which  cannot  be  accessed  at  the  time  of 
assessment. We believe that most of these pages are spam because 
spam  pages  usually  change  their  URL  to  bypass  search  engines’ 
spam list. Meanwhile, ordinary pages wouldn’t change their domain 
name because that hurts their rankings in search engines.  
4.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In  this  paper,  we  propose  user-behavior-oriented  Web  spam 
detection framework, it is a feasible solution to identify Web spam 
pages  effectively  and  type-independently.  In  the  near  future,  we 
hope to extend this framework to embody the state-of-the-art page 
content  and  hyperlink  features.  We  also  plan  to  work  on  a  Web 
page quality estimation model based on our findings in this paper.
