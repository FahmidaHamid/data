ABSTRACT
We analyze dependencies in power law graph data (Web
sample, Wikipedia sample and a preferential attachment
graph) using statistical inference for multivariate regular
variation. The well developed theory of regular variation is
widely applied in extreme value theory, telecommunications
and mathematical ﬁnance, and it provides a natural mathe-
matical formalism for analyzing dependencies between vari-
ables with power laws. However, most of the proposed meth-
ods have never been used in the Web graph data mining.
The present work ﬁlls this gap. The new insights this yields
are striking: the three above-mentioned data sets are shown
to have a totally diﬀerent dependence structure between dif-
ferent graph parameters, such as in-degree and PageRank.

INTRODUCTION

The question of measuring correlations in the Web data
has led to many controversial results. Most notably, there is
no agreement in the literature on the dependence between
in-degree and PageRank of a Web page [4, 5]. One of the
main points that we make in this work is that the commonly
used correlation coeﬃcient is an uninformative dependence
measure in heavy-tailed data [3, 7] typical for the Web and
Wikipedia graphs.

A natural mathematical formalism for analyzing power
laws is provided by the theory of regular variation. By def-
inition, the distribution F has a regularly varying tail with
index α, if P(X > x) = x−αL(x), x > 0, where L(x) is a
slowly varying function, that is, for x > 0, L(tx)/L(t) → 1
as t → ∞. Below we analyze the dependence structure in
the power law data by means of contemporary statistical
techniques specially designed for multivariate regular varia-
tion [7].

2. DATA SETS

We chose three data sets that represent diﬀerent network
structures. As the Web sample, we used the EU-2005 data
set with 862.664 nodes and 19.235.140 links, that was col-
lected by LAW [1]. We also performed experiments on the
Wikipedia(En) graph, that contains 4.881.983 nodes and
42.062.836 links. Finally, we simulated a Growing Net-
work by using preferential attachment rule for 90% of new
links [2]. The graph consists of 10.000 nodes with constant
out-degree d = 8. In Figure 1 we show the cumulative log-

log plots for in-degrees, out-degrees and PageRank scores

where P R(i) is the PageRank of page i, dj is the number of
outgoing links of page j, the sum is taken over all pages j
that link to page i, D is a set of dangling nodes, and c is the
damping factor, which is equal 0.85 in our case. Throughout
the paper we use the scaled PageRank scores R(i) = nP R(i).
The log-log plots for in-degree and PageRank in Figure 1
resemble the signature straight line indicating power laws.
However, several techniques should be combined in order
to establish the presence of heavy tails and to evaluate the
power law exponent. Using QQ plots, Hill and altHill plots
as well as Pickands plots [7] we conﬁrm that the in-degree
and PageRank follow power laws with similar exponents for
all three data sets. We also conclude that the out-degree can
be modeled reasonably well as a power law with exponent
around 2.5-3, see [8] for details.

Although all plots in Figure 1 look alike, it does not im-
ply that the three networks have identical structure. The
main goal of the present work is to rigorously examine the
dependencies between the network parameters.

3. ANGULAR MEASURE

Suppose we are interested in analyzing the dependencies
between two regular varying characteristics of a node, X and
Y . Let Xj and Yj be observations of X and Y for the corre-
sponding node j. Following [7], we start by using the rank
j ), 1 ≤ j ≤ n},
transformation of (X, Y ), leading to {(rx
j is the descending rank of Xj in (X1, . . . , Xn) and ry
where rx
j
is the descending rank of Yj in (Y1, . . . , Yn). Next we choose
k = 1, . . . , n and apply the polar coordinate transform as
follows

j , ry

= (Rj,k, Θj,k),

(cid:7)

.

where POLAR(x, y) =

Now we need to consider the points {Θi,k : Ri,k > 1}
and make a plot for cumulative distribution function of Θ.
In other words, we are interested in the angular measure,
in the empirical distribution of Θ for k largest values
i.e.
of R. Thus, unlike the correlation coeﬃcient, the angular
measure provides a subtle characterization of the dependen-
cies in the tails of X and Y, or, extremal dependencies. If
such measure is concentrated around π/4 then we observe a
tendency toward complete dependence, when a large value
of X appears simultaneously with a large value of Y . In the
opposite case, when such large values almost never appear
together, we have either large value of X or large value of Y ,
hence, Θ should be around 0 or π/2. The middle case plots
can be seen as a tendency to dependency or independency.
In the case of bi-variate data, a suitable value of k can be
determined by making a Starica plot [7]. We consider radii
R1,k, . . . , Rn,k from (1) and write R(i) for the ith largest
value. To get Starica plot we graph

(cid:8)(cid:9)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)
, 1 ≤ j ≤ n

.

R(j)/R(k), jR(j)/kR(k)

The idea is that for good k the ratio in the ordinate should be
roughly a constant and equal 1 for the values of the abscissa
in the neighborhood of 1. The plot looks diﬀerent for the
diﬀerent parameters k and one can either ﬁnd a suitable k by
trial and error or use numerical algorithms. In general, if the
plot is going steep up from y = 1 at x = 1 then the chosen
k is too large. On the other hand, if the graph stabilizes
around y = 1 for some x < 1 then it means that k is too
small, and we miss some valuable tail data. In Figure 2(a)
we show the Starica plot for in-degree and PageRank in the
Web data sets for k = 100.000 as an example. We refer to [8]
for more details and results.

4. DEPENDENCE MEASUREMENTS
We computed the pairwise angular measure for the suit-
able k’s determined in [8]. In Figure 2(b-d) we depict θ ∈
[0, π/2] against the fraction of observations where the angle
Θ is greater or equal to θ.

The results are striking. For the Wikipedia data set we
observe the independence of the tails of in-degree and Page-
Rank. That is, an extremely high in-degree almost never
implies an extremely high ranking. The picture is com-
pletely opposite for Growing Networks, where the angu-
lar measure is indicating a complete dependence. Thus, in
highly centralized preferential attachment graphs, most con-
nected nodes are also most highly ranked. Finally, the Web
graph exhibits a subtle dependence structure with an angu-
lar measure close to uniform on [0, π/2]. This suggests that

Figure 2: (a) Starica plot for in-degree and PageRank for
EU-2005 data set; Cumulative functions for Angular Mea-
sures: (b) in-degree and PageRank; (c) in- and out-degrees;
(d) out-degree and PageRank

the PageRank popularity measure can not be replaced by
in-degree without signiﬁcant disturbance in the ranking.

The picture is diﬀerent in Figure 2(c). In the Web, the
in- and out-degree tend to be independent which justiﬁes the
distinction between hubs and authorities. In Wikipedia the
degrees are dependent but this dependence is not absolute.
Finally, the dependence between out-degree and PageRank
in the Web and Wikipedia resembles the patterns observed
for in-degree and PageRank.

These results are useful in several ways. First, they re-
veal some important structural features thus extending our
knowledge on real-life networks. Second, by comparing the
dependencies for experimental and synthetic data we can
considerably improve existing graph models.
