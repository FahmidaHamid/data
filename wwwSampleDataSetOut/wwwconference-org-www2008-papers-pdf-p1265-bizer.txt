ABSTRACT 
The Web is increasingly understood as a global information space 
consisting  not  just  of  linked  documents,  but  also  of  Linked  Data. 
More than just a vision, the resulting Web of Data has been brought 
into being by the maturing of the Semantic Web technology stack, 
and  by  the  publication  of  an  increasing  number  of  datasets 
according to the principles of Linked Data.  
The  Linked  Data  on  the  Web  (LDOW2008)  workshop  brings 
together  researchers  and  practitioners  working  on  all  aspects  of 
Linked Data. The workshop  provides a forum to present the state of 
the  art  in  the  field  and  to  discuss  ongoing  and  future  research 
challenges. In this workshop summary we will outline the technical 
context in which Linked Data is situated, describe developments in 
the  past  year  through  initiatives  such  as  the  Linking  Open  Data 
community project, and look ahead to the workshop itself.

1.  THE WEB OF DATA 
Linked  Data 
the  Resource  Description 
is  about  employing 
Framework (RDF) and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to 
publish  structured  data  on  the  Web  and  to  connect  data  between 
different data sources, effectively allowing data in one data source 
to be linked to data in another data source.  
The principles of Linked Data were first outlined by Berners-Lee in 
2006 [1], and provide broad guidance upon which data publishers 
have  begun  to  realize  the  Web  of  Data.  This  guidance  has  been 
extended  by  technical  documents  such  as  [2][3]  that  capture  best 
practices  emerging  from  the  Linked Data community and provide 
recipes on which publishing systems can be based.  
The Web of Data can be accessed using Linked Data browsers, just 
as  the  traditional  Web  of  documents  is  accessed  using  HTML 
browsers.  However,  instead  of  following  links  between  HTML 
pages,  Linked  Data  browsers  enable  users  to  navigate  between 
different data sources by following RDF links. This allows the user 
to start with one data source and then move through a potentially 
endless Web of data sources connected by RDF links.  Just as the 
traditional  document  Web  can  be  crawled  by  following  hypertext

links,  the  Web  of  Data  can  be  crawled  by  following  RDF  links. 
Working  on  the  crawled  data,  search  engines  can  provide 
sophisticated  query  capabilities,  similar  to  those  provided  by 
conventional  relational  databases.  Because 
the  query  results 
themselves are structured data, not just links to HTML pages, they 
can  be  immediately  processed,  thus  enabling  a  new  class  of 
applications based on the Web of Data. 
The  glue  that  holds  together  the  traditional  document  Web  is  the 
hypertext links between HTML pages. The glue of the data web is 
RDF  links.  An  RDF  link  simply  states  that  one  piece  of data has 
some  kind  of  relationship  to  another  piece  of  data.  These 
relationships  can  have  different  types.  For  instance,  an  RDF  link 
that connects data about people can state that two people know each 
other; an RDF link that connects information about a person with 
information  about  publications  in  a  bibliographic  database  might 
state that a person is the author of a specific paper. 
2.  THE LINKING OPEN DATA PROJECT 
Evidence  of  the  emergence  of  a  Web  of  Data  comes  from  the 
Linking Open Data project1, a grassroots community effort founded 
in  February  2007  and  supported  by  the  W3C  Semantic  Web 
Education and Outreach Working Group2. The aim of the project is 
to identify datasets that are available under open licenses, re-publish 
these in RDF on the Web and interlink them with each other. 
During 2007, the size of the Web of Data that directly stems from 
this  community  effort  has  grown  to  over  two  billion  RDF  triples, 
originating  from  data  sets  in  diverse  domains  such  as  geographic 
information,  census 
information,  people,  companies,  online 
communities,  human  languages,  scientific  publications,  films, 
music,  books  and  reviews3.  These  data  sets  are  interlinked  by 
around three million RDF links. 
An  indication  of  the  range  and  scale  of  the  Linking  Open  Data 
"cloud"  is  provided  in  Figure  1.  As  this  diagram  shows,  key 
interlinking  hubs  are  sites  such  as  DBpedia4  and  Geonames5. 
DBpedia extracts RDF triples from the "Infoboxes" commonly seen 
on  the  right  hand  side  of  Wikipedia  articles,  and  makes  these 
available  on  the  Web  in  RDF  to  be  crawled  or  queried  with 
SPARQL.  Geonames  in  turn  provides  RDF  descriptions  of 
millions of geographical locations worldwide. DBpedia and Geo-

names  provide  URIs  (and  RDF  descriptions)  for  many  of  the 
things in the world to which we want to refer. As these URIs are 
reused within other data sets, DBpedia and Geonames develop 
into hubs to which an increasing number of other data sets are 
connected, thereby increasing the potential for network effects.  
In addition to publishing and interlinking datasets, there is also 
ongoing  work  within  the  community  project  on  Linked  Data 
browsers,  Linked  Data  crawlers,  Web  of  Data  search  engines 
and other applications that consume Linked Data from the Web. 
Examples  of  Linked  Data  browsers6  are  Tabulator,  Disco,  the 
OpenLink  data  browser  and  the  Zitgist  browser.  Examples  of 
Web  of  Data  search  engines7  and  lookup  indexes  are  Falcons, 
Sindice,  Swoogle  and  Watson.  These  services  enable  humans 
and  machines  to  locate  and  query  Linked  Data  that  has  been 
published across the Web. 
3.  THE LDOW WORKSHOP 
The goal of the LDOW workshop is to provide a forum for the 
Linked Data community, in which participants can present and 
discuss  approaches  to  publishing  Linked  Data  on  the  Web,  
showcase  innovative  applications  that  consume  Linked  Data,

the  workshop  and 

and shape the agenda and identify upcoming research issues for 
the next development stage of the Web of Data.  
The  program  of  papers  to  be  presented  at  the  workshop 
demonstrates ongoing innovation not just in populating the Web 
of  data,  but  in  developing  applications  that  exploit  this 
ecosystem  for  end  users,  and  in  advancing  conceptual  and 
architectural  issues  related  to  the  field.  In  total  37  papers  and 
demos  were  submitted  for  review,  of  which  23  were  accepted 
for  presentation  at 
the 
proceedings.  
We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the LDOW2008 
Program Committee for the efforts they expended in reviewing 
the submitted papers, and to the WWW2008 organizers for their 
support  of  the  workshop.  For  more  information  about  the 
workshop program please refer to the workshop website:
