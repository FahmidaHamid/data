discussion phase to reconcile conflicting opinions. The workshop 
not only attracted the researchers from universities’ professionals 
but also attracted researchers from industry community. We had 
an  invited  talk  presented  by  Dr.  Edward  Chang  to  stress  the 
interdisciplinary challenges of SWN search and mining. 

WORKSHOP THEME AND TOPICS 
Topics in Social Web search and mining of interest included: 

MOTIVATION 
The  WWW  2008  workshop  of  social  Web  search  and  mining  
(SWSM2008) aims to discuss key issues of searching and mining 
a  special  kind  of  increasingly  important  sources:  Social  Web 
(SW).

• 

 Algorithms for SW search 

 Personalized search for social interaction 

•  User behaviour prediction 

include  blogs, 

There  are  a  growing  number  of  highly-popular  user-centric 
applications, especially with the popularity of the Web 2.0. Such 
examples 
folksonomies,  wikis  and  Web 
communities in specific topics such as in academic research area. 
They  have  formed  a  new  Web,  Social  Web  and  further  formed 
social  networks  (SWN.)  SWN  generates  a  lot  of  structured  and 
semi-structured information. This information greatly enlarges the 
content of Web. At the same time, it introduces many interesting 
research issues (e.g., social web storage, search and mining, social 
network building, expertise oriented search and association search 
in social networks) and as well many real-world applications (e.g. 
web  community  detection  and  search,  hot-topic  detection  in  a 
specific  web  community).  These  research  issues  have  been 
receiving  in  the  recent  years  growing  attentions.  SWSM2008 
aimed at providing a forum for researchers from all over the world 
to share information on their latest investigations in SWN search, 
mining and its application particularly in academic research area.  

WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION 
SWSM2008  is  a  half  day  workshop  under  the  theme  of  Social 
Web. We had 18 submissions, of which we accepted 8 papers as 
regular papers and 4 papers as short papers. All papers underwent 
a review process by the program committee and each paper was 
reviewed  by  at  least  three  reviewers,  followed  by  an  online
