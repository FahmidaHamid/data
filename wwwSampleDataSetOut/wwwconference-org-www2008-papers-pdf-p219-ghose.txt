ABSTRACT 
The  phenomenon  of  sponsored  search  advertising  is  gaining 
ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines. Firms 
across different industries have are beginning to adopt this as the 
primary  form  of  online  advertising.  This  process  works  on  an 
auction  mechanism 
in  which  advertisers  bid  for  different 
keywords, and final rank for a given keyword is allocated by the 
search engine. But how different are firm’s actual bids from their 
optimal bids? Moreover, what are other ways in which firms can 
potentially  benefit  from sponsored search advertising? Based on 
the  model  and  estimates  from  prior  work  [10],  we  conduct  a 
number  of  policy  simulations  in  order  to  investigate  to  what 
extent  an  advertiser  can  benefit  from  bidding  optimally  for  its 
keywords.  Further,  we  build  a  Hierarchical  Bayesian  modeling 
framework to explore the potential for cross-selling or spillovers 
effects  from  a  given  keyword  advertisement  across  multiple 
product  categories,  and  estimate the model using Markov Chain 
Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  methods.  Our  analysis  suggests  that 
advertisers are not bidding optimally with respect to maximizing 
profits.  We  conduct  a  detailed  analysis  with  product  level 
variables  to  explore  the  extent  of  cross-selling  opportunities 
across different categories from a given keyword advertisement. 
We  find  that  there  exists  significant  potential  for  cross-selling 
through  search  keyword  advertisements  in  that  consumers  often 
end  up  buying  products  from  other  categories  in  addition to the 
product  they  were  searching  for.  Latency  (the  time  it  takes  for 
consumer  to  place  a  purchase  order  after  clicking  on  the 
advertisement) and the presence of a brand name in the keyword 
are associated with consumer spending on product categories that 
are different from the one they were originally searching for on 
the Internet.

the  growth  of  search  advertising,  we  have 

unique  position  to  try  new  forms  of  advertisements  without 
annoying  consumers.  In  this  regard,  the  advent  of  sponsored 
search  advertisements  –  the  delivery  of  relevant,  targeted  text 
advertisements  as  part  of  the  search  experience,  makes  it 
increasingly  possible  for  firms  to  attract  consumers  to  their 
websites.  These keyword advertisements are based on customers’ 
own queries and are thus considered far less intrusive than online 
banner  advertisements  or  pop-ups.  In  many  ways,  one  could 
imagine  that  this  enabled  a  shift  in  advertising  from  ‘mass’ 
advertising to more ‘targeted’ advertising. By allotting a specific 
value to each keyword, an advertiser only pays the assigned price 
for  the  people  who  click  on  their  listing  to  visit  its  website. 
Because  listings  appear  when  a  keyword  is  searched  for,  an 
advertiser  can  reach  a  more  targeted  audience  on  a  much  lower 
budget.  Hence,  it  is  now  considered  to  be  among  the  most 
effective marketing vehicles available in the online world. 
little 
Despite 
understanding  of  how  consumers  respond  to  sponsored  search 
advertising  on  the  Internet.  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  two 
previously unexplored questions: (i) For a given set of keywords, 
what is the spread between the optimal bid prices and the actual 
cost-per-click  incurred  by  the  advertiser  in  the  aftermath  of  an 
auction? (ii) Can firms benefit from cross-selling or spillovers in 
paid search advertising? While an emerging stream of theoretical 
literature  in  sponsored  search  has  looked  at  issues  such  as 
mechanism  design  in  keyword  auctions,  no  prior  work  has 
empirically  analyzed  these  questions.  We  adopt  the  model  and 
estimates from [10] to explore this divergence between actual cost 
per  clicks  and  the  bid  price  that  would  maximize  advertiser 
profits.    Further,  using  a  panel  dataset  of  several  hundred 
keywords  collected  from  a 
that 
advertises  on  Google,  we  empirically  estimate  the  impact  of 
keyword attributes (such as the presence of retailer information, 
brand  information  and  the  length  of  the  keyword)  on  consumer 
purchase propensities across different categories after clicking on 
a specific keyword. This enables us to evaluate the cross-selling 
potential  of  sponsored  search  by  tracking  the  cross-category 
spillover  effects  of  a  click-through  on  a  given  keyword 
advertisement.

DATA 

2. 
Our data is the same as [10] and contains weekly information on 
paid  search  advertising  from  a  large  nationwide  retail  chain, 

219WWW 2008 / Refereed Track: Internet Monetization - Sponsored SearchApril 21-25, 2008 · Beijing, Chinawhich  advertises  on  Google.1  The  data  span  all  keyword 
advertisements by the company during a period of three months in 
the  first  quarter  of  2007,  specifically  for  the  13  calendar  weeks 
from  January  1  to  March  31.  Unlike  most  datasets  used  to 
investigate  on-line  environments  which  usually  comprise  of 
browsing  behavior  only,  our  data  are  unique  in  that  we  have 
individual  level  stimulus  (advertising)  and  response  (purchase 
incidence).  
Each  keyword  in  our  data has a unique advertisement ID. Once 
the  advertiser  gets  a  rank  allotted  (based  on  the  bid  price)  to 
display its textual ad, these sponsored ads show up on the top left, 
right  and  bottom  of  the  computer  screen  in  response  to  a  query 
that a consumer types on the search engine. The serving of a text 
ad in response to a query for a certain keyword is denoted as an 
impression.  If  the  consumer  clicks  on  the  ad,  he  is  led  to  the 
landing  page  of  the  advertiser’s  website.  This  is  recorded  as  a 
click, and advertisers usually pay on a per click basis. In the event 
that  the  consumer  ends  up  purchasing  a  product  from  the 
advertiser, this is recorded as a conversion. The time between a 
click and an actual purchase is known as latency. This is usually 
measured  in  days.  In  the  majority  of  cases  the  value  of  this 
variable  is  0,  denoting  that  the  consumer  placed  an  order  at  the 
same time as when they landed on a firm’s website. 
Our data consists of the number of impressions, number of clicks, 
the  average  cost-per-click  (CPC),  the  rank  of  the  keyword,  the 
number of conversions, the total revenues from a click (revenues 
from conversion) and the average order value for a given keyword 
for a given week. Given that these are second price auctions, the 
CPC is likely to be highly correlated with the actual bid price in 
the  case  of  a  successful  bid.  While  a  search  can  lead  to  an 
impression,  and  often  to  a  click,  it  may  not  lead  to  an  actual 
purchase  (defined  as  a  conversion).  The  product  of  CPC  and 
number of clicks gives the total costs to the firm for sponsoring a 
particular  advertisement.  Thus  the  difference  in  revenues  and 
costs gives the profits accruing to the retailer from advertising a 
given  keyword  in  a  given  week.  Our  dataset  includes  5147 
observations  from  a  total  of  1799  unique  keywords  that  had  at 
least one positive impression.  

2.1  Keyword Characteristics  
As described in [10], there are three important keyword specific 
characteristics for a firm (the advertiser) when it advertises on a 
search engine. This includes whether the keyword should have (i) 
retailer-specific  information,  (ii)  brand-specific  information,  (iii) 
and  the  length  (number  of  words)  of  the  keyword.  A  consumer 
seeking  to  purchase  a  digital  camera  is  as  likely  to search for a 
popular brand name such as NIKON, CANON or KODAK on a 
search engine as searching for the generic phrase “digital camera” 
on  the  same  search  engine.  Similarly,  the  same  consumer  may 
search directly for a retailer such as “BEST BUY” or “CIRCUIT 
CITY”  on  the  search  engine.  In  recognition  of  these  electronic 
marketplace  realities,  search  engines  do  not  merely  sell  generic 
identifiers such as “digital cameras” as keywords, but also well-
known  brand  names  that  can  be  purchased  by  any  third-party 
advertiser in order to attract consumers to its Web site. The length 
of  the  keyword  is  also  an  important  determinant  of  search  and

agreement between the firm and us, we are unable to reveal the name of 
the firm. 

purchase  behavior  but  anecdotal  evidence  on  this  varies  across 
trade press reports. Some studies have shown that the percentage 
of searchers who use a combination of keywords is 1.6 times the 
percentage  of  those  who  use  single-keyword  queries  [19].  To 
investigate the impact of the length of a keyword, we constructed 
a variable that indicates the number of words in a keyword that a 
user queried for on the search engine    (in response to which the 
paid advertisement was displayed to the user). 
The dataset was enhanced by introducing some keyword-specific 
characteristics  such  as  Brand,  Retailer  and  Length.  For  each 
keyword, we constructed two dummy variables, based on whether 
they  were  (i)  branded  or  unbranded  keywords  and  (ii)  retailer-
specific  or  non-retailer  specific  keywords.  To  be  precise,  for 
creating the variable in (i) we looked for the presence of a brand 
name  (either  a  product-specific  or  a  company  specific)  in  the 
keyword, and labeled the dummy as 1 or 0, with 1 indicating the 
presence of a brand name. For (ii), we looked for the presence of 
the advertising retailer’s name in the keyword, and then labeled 
the  dummy  as  1  or  0,  with  1  indicating  the  presence  of  the 
retailer’s  name.  There  were  no  keywords  that  contained  both 
retailer name and brand name information. This enabled a clean 
classification in our data.  This classification is similar in notion 
to  [2,  13]  who  classify  user  queries  in  search  engines  as 
navigational 
retailer), 
transactional  (searching  for  a  specific  product)  or informational 
(longer keywords).

POLICY SIMULATIONS 

3. 
A primary goal of research is to evaluate and recommend optimal 
policies for marketing actions. One way of doing this is to assess 
current decision-making behavior and compare them with optimal 
decision-making  behavior.  Towards  this  objective,  we  estimate 
the optimal bid price for each keyword and assess how much the 
advertiser’s decision (actual bid price) deviates from the optimal 
bid price based on our model estimates. We adopt the model from 
[10] and estimate it using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
methods (see [16] for a detailed review of such models). We use 
the  Metropolis-Hastings  algorithm  with  a  random  walk  chain  to 
generate draws. ([4]). Rather than describe the entire Hierarchical 

220WWW 2008 / Refereed Track: Internet Monetization - Sponsored SearchApril 21-25, 2008 · Beijing, ChinaBayesian model, we refer interested readers to [10] and provide a 
summary description of the theoretical framework below.  
Assume  for  search  keyword  i  at  week  j,  there  are  nij  click-
throughs  among  Nij  impressions  (the  number  of  times  an 
advertisement  is  displayed  by  the  retailer),  where  nij  ≤   Nij. 
Suppose  that  among  the  nij  click-throughs,  there  are  mij  click-
throughs  that  lead  to  purchases,  where mij  ≤   nij.  Let  us  further 
assume that the probability of having a click-through is pij and the 
probability of having a purchase is qij. In our model, a consumer 
faces  decisions  at  two  levels  –  one,  when  she  sees  a  keyword 
advertisement, she makes decision whether or not to click it; two, 
if  she  clicks  on  the  advertisement,  she  can  take  any  one  of  the 
following two actions – make a purchase or not make a purchase.  
Thus, there are three types of observations. First, a person clicked 
through and made a purchase. The probability of such an event is 
pijqij.  Second,  a  person  clicked  through  but  did  not  make  a 
purchase. The probability of such an event is pij(1- qij). Third, an 
impression  did  not  lead  to  a  click-through  or  purchase.  The 
probability  of  such  an  event  is  1-  pij.  Then,  the  probability  of 
observing (nij, mij) is given by:

Thereafter,  click-through  rates,  conversion  rates,  cost-per-click, 
and  keyword  ranks  are  analyzed  by  jointly  modeling  the 
consumers’  search  and  purchase  behavior,  the  advertiser’s  bid 
pricing behavior, and the search engine’s keyword rank allocating 
behavior.  The  decision  of  whether  to  click  and  purchase  in  a 
given  week  is  modeled  as  a  function  of  the  probability  of 
advertising  exposure  (for  example,  through  the  Rank  of  the 
keyword)  and 
individual  differences,  both  observed  and 
unobserved  heterogeneity  (for  example,  through  the  keyword-
like  Retailer,  Brand  and  Length).  The 
specific  attributes 
advertiser’s  bid  price  decision  is  modeled  as  a  function  of 
keyword  attributes  and  other  variables  such  as  lagged  values  of 
Rank and Profit. The search engine’s ranking decision is modeled 
as a function of keyword attributes and other factors such as CPC 
and  lagged  values  of  CTR  in  accordance  with  institutional 
practices. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a random walk 
chain is adopted to generate draws in the MCMC methods ([4]).  
Using the parameter estimates from the click-through, conversion 
and  rank  models  from  [10]  and  the  data  on  click-through  rates, 
conversion rates, revenues and actual CPC of each advertisement, 
we  estimate  the  expected  profit  of  the  firm.  We  assume  the 
advertiser  determines  the  optimal  bid  price  for each keyword to 
the  expected  profit  ( Π )  from  each  consumer 
maximize

In equation (2), pij  is the expected click-through rate for keyword 
i  at  week  j,  qij  is  the  expected  conversion  rate  conditional  on  a 
click through, rij  is the expected revenue from a conversion that is 

the  optimization  routine 

observed  from  our  data,  and  CPCij  is  the  actual  cost  per  click  
paid by the advertiser to the search engine for each keyword. pij , 
qij  and  Rankij  are  predicted  based  on  equations  (4.2),  (4.6)  and 
(4.15) respectively in [10], using the estimates obtained from the 
proposed  model.  We  conduct 
to 
maximize the expected profit from each consumer impression of 
the advertisement for each keyword at each week using the grid 
search.  
Our  simulation  results  highlight  that  there  is  a  considerable 
amount of spread in the optimal bid prices and the actual cost per 
click for a given keyword, with the average deviation being 23.3 
cents  per  bid.  Given  that  this  is  a  second  price  auction  and  the 
firm actually pays the bid price of the next highest bidder plus a 
small  increment  of  1  cent,  we  find  that  a  vast  majority  of  the 
keyword  CPCs  actually  highlight  that  the  firm  is  overbidding 
relative to the optimal bid price. Specifically, 6% of the CPCs are 
below the optimal bid prices with the average difference being 67 
cents, while the remaining 94% of the CPCs (and thus the firm’s 
bid  price)  are  above  the  optimal  bid  price  with  the  average 
difference being 28.7 cents.  
We also examined the deviation from the optimal bid prices based 
on  whether  the  keyword  advertisement  had  retailer  or  brand 
information.  On  an  average,  the  firm  was  underbidding  by  11.2 
cents  for  each  ad  that  had  retailer  information  in  it  and  was 
overbidding by 16.4 cents for each ad that had brand information 
in  it.  For  those  keywords  that  did  not  have  retailer  or  brand 
information in them the firm was generally overbidding with the 
range going from 25.4 cents to 27.7 cents. These results are very 
intuitive: the lack of competition for retailer-specific keywords is 
likely to be driving the underbidding behavior while the presence 
of intense competition in branded or generic keywords would be 
driving the overbidding behavior. 
Consequently,  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  divergence 
between  optimal  expected  profits  and  actual  profits  accruing  to 
the firm from their current bid prices, with the average difference 
being 1.14 times the expected profits with actual bid prices. Next 
we  examined  the  sample  based  on  overbidding  or  underbidding 
behavior. We found that the average difference in profits is 1.15 
times the expected profits with actual bid prices when the firm is 
overbidding.  When  the  firm  is  underbidding,  the  ratio  is  1.05. 
When the firm is underbidding, the ratio is 1.05.  Figure 1a and 1b 
highlight the differences from the optimal and actual bid prices.

Difference in Expected Profits from Optimal and Actual Bid Price

Profits using Optimal and Actual Bids 

 
In order to investigate how the three keyword level covariates are 
associated with optimal bid prices, we ran OLS regressions with 
keyword-level  random  effects.  The  dependent  variable  was  the 
optimal  bid  price.  Our  analysis  reveals  that  the  presence  of 
retailer-specific  information  (Retailer)  or  brand-specific  (Brand) 
information  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  optimal  bid  price,  while 
longer keywords (Length) is associated with a lower optimal bid 
price. Specifically, the presence of retailer and brand information 
should lead to an increase in the optimal bid prices by 21.5% and 
3.9%, respectively while an increase in the length of the keyword 
by one word should lead to a decrease in the bid price by 2.3%. 
Note  that  these  results  are  in  contrast  to  the  results  from  [10] 
wherein using actual bid prices we found that the firm is actually 
incurring  a  lower  CPC  when  it  has  either  retailer  or  brand 
information in the keywords, and incurs a higher CPC for longer 
keywords.  
To  summarize,  while  the  firm  is  exhibiting  some  learning 
behavior over time in terms of deciding on bid prices based on its 
rank  and  profit  in  the  previous  period,  our  simulations  suggest 
that it can improve its profits dramatically by bidding optimally. 
Further, it would be better off by placing higher bids on keyword 
advertisement  that  either  have  retailer  or  brand  information  in 
them, and lower bids as keywords become longer. Moreover, we 
also find that expected profits from retailer-specific keywords are 
likely  to  be  much  higher  than  those  from  brand-specific 
keywords.  

ECONOMETRIC MODEL: IMPACT 

4. 
OF SPONSORED SEARCH ON CROSS-
SELLING  
In  this  section,  we  investigate  the  impact  of  sponsored  search 
advertising in a given category on consumer’s propensity to buy 
products  across  other  categories.  Our  dataset  has  detailed 
information  on  the  various  categories  of  products  that  were 
eventually purchased by consumers after they had clicked on any 
given paid advertisement. There are six product categories in our 
data:  bath,  bedding,  electrical  appliances,  home  décor,  kitchen 
and  dining.  Due  to  the  confidentiality  agreement  with  the  firm 
that gave us the data, we are not able to reveal any more details 

about the individual products within these categories. Since, our 
analysis  is  about  the  cross-selling  potential  of  a  given  product-
based  advertisement,  we  exclude  advertisements  that  only  have 
the  retailer  information  in  them  but  no  product  information. 
Hence, we focus on the 166 keywords that have some product or 
product category information imbedded in them. Table 2 reports 
the  summary  statistics  of  the  data.  As  shown,  the  average 
spending is 79 dollars on the searched product category, and 21.8 
dollars  on  the  non-searched  product  category.  The  average 
latency is about one day. These statistics provide some evidence 
suggesting  that  keyword  advertising  can  lead  to  purchases  on  a 
non-searched  product  category,  and  consumers  may  wait  for  a 
while after starting the search to complete an order.

We  cast  our  model  in  a  hierarchical  Bayesian  framework  and

([4]). Each order can lead to a purchase from the searched product 
category and/or from any of the other five non-searched product 
categories. We model the consumer purchase behavior as a two-
stage decision process. In the first stage, the consumer decides on 
how much to spend on the searched product category. We adopt 
the  Tobit  model  specification  to  account  for  a  large  number  of 
zeros  in  consumer  spending  on  either  the  searched  product

category or non-searched product categories. Let’s denote 
 
as the money spent on the searched product category in order j for 
the  searched  keyword  i.  We  assume  there  is  latent  spending 
intention  (

searched product category, that is,

statistically  insignificant  suggesting  that  on  an  average,  and 
consumers spend the same amount in each of these categories (3, 
4 and 5) as they do in category 6 when they search for a product 
in each of these categories.  
What  are  the  main  factors  that  affect  this  kind  of  consumer 
behavior? Based on the estimates in Table 3a and 3b, we find that 
Latency  tends  to  decrease  consumer  spending  on  the  searched 
category, but increase their average spending on the non-searched 
category. Recall that latency is the time between when consumers 
click  on  an  advertisement  and  when  they  actual  purchase  the 
product  from  the  website.  Intuitively,  this  result  suggests  that  if 
consumers delay the final purchase of the product after the initial 
click  on  the  ad,  they  are  likely  to  digress  from  their  original 
spending  intention  in  the  searched  category  and  increasing  their 
purchase of products in other non-searched categories. Note also 
that  the  coefficient  of 
  is  negative  suggesting  that  if  a 
consumer  has  already  spent  a  lot  on  the  category  that  they  had 
originally searched for, then they are likely to spend less on the 
other categories.

increase  consumers’  spending 

Interestingly,  we  find  that  the  presence  of Brand  information  in 
the search keyword advertisement does not affect the amount that 
consumers spend on the category that they originally searched for 
on  the  search engine. However, note from Table 3b that it does 
significantly 
the  other 
categories.  This  implies  that  the  presence  of  a  brand  name  in  a 
keyword  advertisement  can  have  a  strong  switching  effect  on 
consumer’s purchasing propensities. It has a similar flavor to the 
bait  and  switch  strategies  used  by  retailers,  when  they  attract 
consumers  to  their  stores  based  advertisements  in  one  category 
and  then  induce  them  to  buy  a  product  in  a  different  category 
addition to the original product, perhaps through some marketing 
promotion.  Thus,  our  analysis  indicates  a  strong  cross-selling 
potential  of  a  sponsored  search  advertisement  that  contains  a 
cross, 
brand name in it. The statistically significant estimates of γ1
γ2
there  are 
complementary  demands  for  three  product  categories  at  each 
purchase  incidence.  In  particular,  we  see  in  Table  3b  that 
categories  1,  2,  and  3  (bath,  bedding  and  electrical  appliances) 
exhibit the strongest opportunities for cross-selling. 
We  find  that  neither  Rank  nor  the  Length  has  any  impact  on 
consumers’ spending either on the searched category or the non-
searched category. This is not too surprising. Both these attributes 
are  likely  to  influence  consumer  click-through  behavior  but  are 
unlikely  to  affect  their  latent  spending  intention  once  they  have 
already landed on the retailer’s web page. As a robustness check, 
we also fit a model that controls for the potential endogeneity in 
Rank. We found similar results on the coefficient estimates. We 
also  included  dummies  for  different  categories  of  landing  pages 
such as search page, shop, home page, information page, product 
page and category page. This did not affect the qualitative nature 
of the results, and moreover the estimates on the dummies were 
not statistically significant. 

RELATED WORK  

5. 
Our  paper  is  related  to  several  streams  of  research.  First,  it 
contributes to recent research in online advertising in economics 
and marketing by providing the first known empirical analysis of 
sponsored  search  keyword  advertising.  Much  of  the  existing 
academic  (e.g.,  [5],  [6],  [7])  on  advertising  in  online  world  has 
focused  on  measuring  changes  in  brand  awareness,  brand 
attitudes, and purchase intentions as a function of exposure. This 
is usually done via field surveys or laboratory experiments using 
individual  (or  cookie)  level  data.  In  contrast  to  other  studies 
which measure (individual) exposure to advertising via aggregate 
advertising  dollars  ([12]),  we  use  data  on  individual  search 
keyword  advertising  exposure.  [17]  looks  at  online  banner 
advertising.  Because  banner  ads  have  been  perceived  by  many 
consumers  as  being  annoying,  traditionally  they  have  had  a 
negative connotation associated with it. Moreover, it was argued 
that  since  there  is  considerably  evidence  that  only  a  small 
proportion  of  visits  translate  into  final  purchase  ([3],  [6],  [18]), 
click-through  rates  may  be  too  imprecise  for  measuring  the 
effectiveness of banners served to the mass market. Interestingly 
however,  [14]  found  that  banner  advertising  actually  increases 
purchasing  behavior,  in  contrast  to  conventional  wisdom.  These 
studies  therefore  highlight  the  importance  of  investigating  the 
impact  of  other  kinds  of  online  advertising  such  as  search 
keyword  advertising  on  actual  purchase  behavior,  since  the 
success of keyword advertising is also based on consumer click-
through rates.  

A  large  literature  in  economics  sees  advertising  as  necessary  to 
signal  some  form  of  quality  ([11]).  There  is  also  an  emerging 
theoretical  stream  of  literature  exemplified  by  [9,  10]  that 
examines  auction  price  and  mechanism  design  in  keyword 
auctions. Despite the emerging theory work, very little empirical 
work exists in online search advertising. The handful of empirical 
studies  that  exist  in  search  engine  advertising  have  mainly 
analyzed publicly available data from search engines. [1] looks at 
the presence of quality uncertainty and adverse selection in paid 
search  advertising.  [13]  classifies  queries  as  informational, 
navigational,  and  transactional  based  on  the  expected  type  of 
content destination desired and analyze click through patterns of 
each. In a paper related to our work, [20] studied the conversion 
rates of hotel marketing keywords to analyze the profitability of 
different  campaign  management  strategies.  Finally,  in  our  prior 
work [10], we only analyzed the impact of keyword attributes on 
consumer and firm behavior. This paper goes well beyond it by  
conducting  policy  simulations  to  examine  the  optimality  of 
advertiser  strategies.  We  also  substantially  extend  that  work  in 
this  paper  by  examining  the  potential  for  cross-selling  products 
through  sponsored  search  advertisement  and  quantifying  the 
actual impact of specific variables like brand and latency. 
Our  paper  is  also  related  to  the  stream  of work in cross-selling. 
Amongst the first papers that formally model sequential ordering 
and the cross-selling opportunities is [14]. Their research applies 
latent  trait  analysis  to  position  financial  services  and  investors 
along  a  common  continuum.  [15]  present  next  product-to-
purchase  models  that  can  be  used  to  predict  what  is  to  be 
purchased  next  and  when.  [16]  model  consumers’  sequential 
acquisition  decisions  for  multiple  products  and  services,  a 
behavior  that  is  common  in  service  and  consumer  technology 
industries. We thus contribute to the literature by demonstrating 
the cross-selling potential of paid search advertising in an online 
context,  thereby  supplementing  the  existing  stream  of  work  on 
cross-selling. 

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE 

6. 
WORK 
The  phenomenon  of  sponsored  search  advertising  is  gaining 
ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines. In this 
research, we aim to analyze how advertiser’s actual cost per click 
may differ from optimal bid prices. In addition to this, our second 
objective  is  to  enhance  our  understanding  of  how  sponsored 
search  advertising  affects  consumer  purchasing  patterns  on  the 
Internet  by  analyzing  its  cross-selling  potential.  Using  a  unique 
panel  dataset  of  several  hundred  keywords  collected  from  a 
nationwide  retailer  that  advertises  on  Google,  we  empirically 
model  the  relationship  between  different  keyword  attributes  and 
consumer  search  and  purchase  behavior  across  multiple  product 
categories. We use a Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework 
and  estimate  the  model  using  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo 
(MCMC) methods.  
We conduct simulations to assess the relative profit impact from 
changes  in  bid  prices,  and  find  that  despite  some  learning,  the 
advertiser  is  not  bidding  optimally.  What  are  some  of  the 
implications?  Retailer-name  searches  are  navigational  searches, 
and  are  analogous  to  a  customer  finding  the  retailer's  phone 
number or address in the White Pages. These searches are driven 
by brand awareness generated by catalog mailings, TV ads, etc, 
and are likely to have come from more ‘loyal’ consumers. Even

suggest 

the  average  profitability 

though the referral to the retailer’s website came through a search 
engine, the search engine had very little to do with generating the 
demand in the first place. On the other hand, searches on product 
or manufacturer specific brand names are analogous to consumers 
going  to  the  Yellow  Pages—they  know  they  need  a  product  or 
service, but don't yet know where to buy it [10]. These are likely 
to be “competitive” searches. Even for loyal buyers, a “branded” 
search  means  the  searcher  is  surveying  the  market  and  is 
vulnerable to competition. If the advertiser wins the click and the 
order,  that  implies  they  have  taken  market  share  away  from  a 
competitor.  Thus,  retailer-specific  keywords  are  likely  to  be 
searched  and  clicked  by  'loyal'  consumers  who  are  inclined 
towards  buying  from 
that  retailer  whereas  brand-specific 
keywords are likely to be searched and clicked by the 'shoppers or 
searchers’  who  can  easily  switch  to  competition.  Our  policy 
simulations 
from 
conversions generated by 'retailer' keywords is much higher than 
that  from  ‘brand'  keywords.  Our  results  thus  provide  some 
managerial  insights  for  an  advertiser  of  sponsoring  such  retail 
store  keywords  (retailer-specific  keywords)  with  national-brand 
keywords (brand-specific keywords). 
We  have  shown  some  evidence  that  although  the  average click-
through  and  conversion  rates  are  typically  low  in  sponsored 
search,  there  are  other  potential  benefits  from  such  advertising. 
Specifically, retailers can not only refine their keyword purchases 
on  search  engines,  but  also  set  up  relevant  cross-selling 
opportunities  on  their  own  websites  by  advertising  ‘brand-
specific’  keywords.  The  strategy  is  that  when  a  consumer 
searches for a specific product and lands deep within the retailer’s 
website by clicking on its keyword advertisement, the retailer can 
pair  that  product  with  other  products  that  sell  well  with  that 
keyword  and  prominently  feature  them  on  its  website.  This 
provides  a  retailer  with  an  opportunity  to  not  only  convert 
someone on the product they had searched for, but also get other 
opportunities  for  cross-selling.  From  the  retailer’s  perspective, 
there  could  be  synergies 
in  promoting  both  categories 
simultaneously rather than separately. Indeed anecdotal evidence 
suggests that retailers are engaging in the practice of looking up 
the  most-searched  and  the  top-converting  keywords  on  their 
websites, and bidding for them on search engines. They are taking 
cross-selling  reports  from  other  marketing  mix  campaigns  and 
putting up the top cross-selling product for the searched product 
on the same page.  
Interestingly, we find that latency in purchases is not necessarily 
detrimental 
the  keyword 
advertisement. While it is in general associated with a reduction 
in  product  purchases  in  the  category  that  the  consumer  was 
originally searching for, it increases consumers’ spending in other 
product categories. In a way, it has an impact similar to a bait and 
switch strategy. This effect is particularly strong in keywords that 
have a brand name in it, since consumers who click on branded 
keywords  typically  tend  to  spend  more  on  other  categories  than 
the  one  they  were  originally  searching  for.  Thus,  online 
advertisers  can  focus  on  investing  more  often  in  such  keywords 
relative to the generic keywords, especially if the cannibalization 
effect  of  drawing  out  consumers  from  one  category  is  smaller 
relative to revenue expansion effect. From the point of view of the 
manufacturer,  such  dependencies  across  categories  may  be 
exploited  by  running  cooperative  promotions  within  brands  but 
across categories. Of course, such decisions would need a detailed 
profitability analysis based not only on the potential from cross-

is  sponsoring 

for  a 

firm 

that 

selling in other product categories but also the performance of the 
keyword in its own category. 
We  are  cognizant  of  the  limitations  of  our  paper.  These 
limitations  arise  primarily  from  the  lack  of  information  in  our 
data. For example, we do not have data on competition. That is, 
we do not know the keyword auction ranks or other performance 
metrics  such  as  click-through  rates  and  conversion  rates  of  the 
keyword advertisements of the competitors of the firm whose data 
we  have  used  in  this  paper.  Future  research  can  use  data  on 
competition  and  highlight  some  more  insights  on  how  firms 
should manage a paid search campaign by running more detailed 
policy  simulations 
that  incorporate  competitive  bid  prices. 
Further,  we  do  not  have  any  knowledge  of  the  other  marketing 
variables  such  as  any  promotions  during  consumers’  search  and 
purchase  visits.  Future  work  can  investigate  the  value  to  firms 
from  participating  in  such  sponsored  search  advertising  by 
comparing  the  performance  of  sponsored  searches  with  natural 
searches using a common pool of keywords during the same time 
period. By collecting information on the ranks and page numbers 
of  the  natural  search  listings  for  the  same  keywords  as  those  in 
paid search, one can study the impact of natural search listings on 
paid  search  advertisements  and  vice-versa.  We  hope  that  this 
study  will  generate  further  interest  in  exploring  this  important 
emerging area in web search.
