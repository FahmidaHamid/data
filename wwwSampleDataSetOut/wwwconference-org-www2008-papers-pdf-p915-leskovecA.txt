ABSTRACT
We present a study of anonymized data capturing a month
of high-level communication activities within the whole of
the Microsoft Messenger instant-messaging system. We ex-
amine characteristics and patterns that emerge from the col-
lective dynamics of large numbers of people, rather than the
actions and characteristics of individuals. The dataset con-
tains summary properties of 30 billion conversations among
240 million people. From the data, we construct a commu-
nication graph with 180 million nodes and 1.3 billion undi-
rected edges, creating the largest social network constructed
and analyzed to date. We report on multiple aspects of
the dataset and synthesized graph. We ﬁnd that the graph
is well-connected and robust to node removal. We inves-
tigate on a planetary-scale the oft-cited report that people
are separated by “six degrees of separation” and ﬁnd that
the average path length among Messenger users is 6.6. We
also ﬁnd that people tend to communicate more with each
other when they have similar age, language, and location,
and that cross-gender conversations are both more frequent
and of longer duration than conversations with the same
gender.

INTRODUCTION

Large-scale web services provide unprecedented opportu-
nities to capture and analyze behavioral data on a plan-
etary scale. We discuss ﬁndings drawn from aggregations
of anonymized data representing one month (June 2006) of
high-level communication activities of people using the Mi-
crosoft Messenger instant-messaging (IM) network. We did
not have nor seek access to the content of messages. Rather,
we consider structural properties of a communication graph
and study how structure and communication relate to user
demographic attributes, such as gender, age, and location.
The data set provides a unique lens for studying patterns of
human behavior on a wide scale.

We explore a dataset of 30 billion conversations generated
by 240 million distinct users over one month. We found that
approximately 90 million distinct Messenger accounts were
accessed each day and that these users produced about 1 bil-
lion conversations, with approximately 7 billion exchanged
messages per day. 180 million of the 240 million active ac-
counts had at least one conversation on the observation pe-
riod. We found that 99% of the conversations occurred be-
tween 2 people, and the rest with greater numbers of partic-
ipants. To our knowledge, our investigation represents the
largest and most comprehensive study to date of presence
and communications in an IM system. A recent report [6]
estimated that approximately 12 billion instant messages are
sent each day. Given the estimate and the growth of IM, we
estimate that we captured approximately half of the world’s
IM communication during the observation period.

We created an undirected communication network from
the data where each user is represented by a node and an
edge is placed between users if they exchanged at least one
message during the month of observation. The network rep-
resents accounts that were active during June 2006. In sum-
mary, the communication graph has 180 million nodes, rep-
resenting users who participated in at least one conversation,
and 1.3 billion undirected edges among active users, where
an edge indicates that a pair of people communicated. We
note that this graph should be distinguished from a buddy
graph where two people are connected if they appear on each
other’s contact lists. The buddy graph for the data contains
240 million nodes and 9.1 billion edges. On average each
account has approximately 50 buddies on a contact list.

To highlight several of our key ﬁndings, we discovered that
the communication network is well connected, with 99.9%
of the nodes belonging to the largest connected component.
We evaluated the oft-cited ﬁnding by Travers and Milgram
that any two people are linked to one another on average
via a chain with “6-degrees-of-separation” [17]. We found
that the average shortest path length in the Messenger net-
work is 6.6 (median 6), which is half a link more than the
path length measured in the classic study. However, we
also found that longer paths exist in the graph, with lengths
up to 29. We observed that the network is well clustered,
with a clustering coeﬃcient [19] that decays with exponent
−0.37. This decay is signiﬁcantly lower than the value we
had expected given prior research [11]. We found strong
homophily [9, 12] among users; people have more conversa-
tions and converse for longer durations with people who are
similar to themselves. We ﬁnd the strongest homophily for
the language used, followed by conversants’ geographic lo-

915WWW 2008 / Alternate Track: Industrial Practice and ExperienceApril 21-25, 2008 · Beijing, Chinacations, and then age. We found that homophily does not
hold for gender; people tend to converse more frequently
and with longer durations with the opposite gender. We
also examined the relation between communication and dis-
tance, and found that the number of conversations tends to
decrease with increasing geographical distance between con-
versants. However, communication links spanning longer
distances tend to carry more and longer conversations.

INSTANT MESSAGING

The use of IM has been become widely adopted in personal
and businesss communications. IM clients allow users fast,
near-synchronous communication, placing it between syn-
chronous communication mediums, such as real-time voice
interactions, and asynchronous communication mediums like
email [18]. IM users exchange short text messages with one
or more users from their list of contacts, who have to be on-
line and logged into the IM system at the time of interaction.
As conversations and messages exchanged within them are
usually very short, it has been observed that users employ
informal language, loose grammar, numerous abbreviations,
with minimal punctuation [10]. Contact lists are commonly
referred to as buddy lists and users on the lists are referred
to as buddies.
2.1 Research on Instant Messaging

Several studies on smaller datasets are related to this
work. Avrahami and Hudson [3] explored communication
characteristics of 16 IM users. Similarly, Shi et al. [13] ana-
lyzed IM contact lists submitted by users to a public website
and explored a static contact network of 140,000 people. Re-
cently, Xiao et al. [20] investigated IM traﬃc characteristics
within a large organization with 400 users of Messenger. Our
study diﬀers from the latter study in that we analyze the full
Messenger population over a one month period, capturing
the interaction of user demographic attributes, communica-
tion patterns, and network structure.
2.2 Data description

To construct the Microsoft Instant Messenger communica-
tion dataset, we combined three diﬀerent sources of data: (1)
user demographic information, (2) time and user stamped
events describing the presence of a particular user, and (3)
communication session logs, where, for all participants, the
number of exchanged messages and the periods of time spent
participating in sessions is recorded.

We use the terms session and conversation interchange-
ably to refer to an IM interaction among two or more people.
Although the Messenger system limits the number of peo-
ple communicating at the same time to 20, people can enter
and leave a conversation over time. We note that, for large
sessions, people can come and go over time, so conversations
can be long with many diﬀerent people participating. We
observed some very long sessions with more than 50 partic-
ipants joining over time.

All of our data was anonymized; we had no access to per-
sonally identiﬁable information. Also, we had no access to
text of the messages exchanged or any other information
that could be used to uniquely identify users. We focused on
analyzing high-level characteristics and patterns that emerge
from the collective dynamics of 240 million people, rather
than the actions and characteristics of individuals. The an-
alyzed data can be split into three parts: presence data,
communication data, and user demographic information:

• Presence events: These include login, logout, ﬁrst
ever login, add, remove and block a buddy, add un-
registered buddy (invite new user), change of status
(busy, away, be-right-back, idle, etc.). Events are user
and time stamped.

• Communication: For each user participating in the
session, the log contains the following tuple: session id,
user id, time joined the session, time left the session,
number of messages sent, number of messages received.
• User data: For each user, the following self-reported
information is stored: age, gender, location (country,
ZIP), language, and IP address. We use the IP address
to decode the geographical coordinates, which we then
use to position users on the globe and to calculate dis-
tances.

We gathered data for 30 days of June 2006. Each day
yielded about 150 gigabytes of compressed text logs (4.5
terabytes in total). Copying the data to a dedicated eight-
processor server with 32 gigabytes of memory took 12 hours.
Our log-parsing system employed a pipeline of four threads
that parse the data in parallel, collapse the session join/leave
events into sets of conversations, and save the data in a com-
pact compressed binary format. This process compressed
the data down to 45 gigabytes per day. Processing the data
took an additional 4 to 5 hours per day.

A special challenge was to account for missing and dropped
events, and session “id recycling” across diﬀerent IM servers
in a server farm. As part of this process, we closed a session
48 hours after the last leave session event. We closed sessions
automatically if only one user was left in the conversation.

3. USAGE & POPULATION STATISTICS

We shall ﬁrst review several statistics drawn from aggre-

gations of users and their communication activities.
3.1 Levels of activity

Over the observation period, 242,720,596 users logged into
Messenger and 179,792,538 of these users were actively en-
gaged in conversations by sending or receiving at least one
IM message. Over the month of observation, 17,510,905 new
accounts were activated. As a representative day, on June
1 2006, there were almost 1 billion (982,005,323) diﬀerent
sessions (conversations among any number of people), with
more than 7 billion IM messages sent. Approximately 93
million users logged in with 64 million diﬀerent users becom-
ing engaged in conversations on that day. Approximately 1.5
million new users that were not registered within Microsoft
Messenger were invited to join on that particular day.

We consider event distributions on a per-user basis in Fig-
ure 1. The number of logins per user, displayed in Fig-
ure 1(a), follows a heavy-tailed distribution with exponent
3.6. We note spikes in logins at 20 minute and 15 second
intervals, which correspond to an auto-login function of the
IM client. As shown in Figure 1(b), many users ﬁll up their
contact lists rather quickly. The spike at 600 buddies un-
doubtedly reﬂects the maximal allowed length of contact
lists.

Figure 2(a) displays the number of users per session. In
Messenger, multiple people can participate in conversations.
We observe a peak at 20 users, the limit on the number of
people who can participate simultaneously in a conversa-
tion. Figure 2(b) shows the distribution over the session
durations, which can be modeled by a power-law distribu-
tion with exponent 3.6.

Next, we examine the distribution of the durations of pe-
riods of time when people are logged on to the system. Let
(tij , toj) denote a time ordered (tij < toj < tij+1) sequence
of online and oﬄine times of a user, where tij is the time
of the jth login, and toj is the corresponding logout time.
Figure 3(a) plots the distribution of toj − tij over all j over
all users. Similarly, Figure 3(b) shows the distribution of
the periods of time when users are logged oﬀ, i.e. tij+1 − toj
over all j and over all users. Fitting the data to power-law
distributions reveals exponents of 1.77 and 1.3, respectively.
The data shows that durations of being online tend to be
shorter and decay faster than durations that users are of-
ﬂine. We also notice periodic eﬀects of login durations of
12, 24, and 48 hours, reﬂecting daily periodicities. We ob-
serve similar periodicities for logout durations at multiples
of 24 hours.
3.2 Demographic characteristics of the users
We compared the demographic characteristics of the Mes-
senger population with 2005 world census data and found
diﬀerences between the statistics for age and gender. The
visualization of this comparison displayed in Figure 4 shows
that users with reported ages in the 15–35 span of years are

strongly overrepresented in the active Messenger population.
Focusing on the diﬀerences by gender, females are overrep-
resented for the 10–14 age interval. For male users, we see
overall matches with the world population for age spans 10–
14 and 35˚U39; for women users, we see a match for ages in
the span of 30–34. We note that 6.5% of the population did
not submit an age when creating their Messenger accounts.

4. COMMUNICATION CHARACTERISTICS

We now focus on characteristics and patterns with com-
munications. We limit the analysis to conversations between
two participants, which account for 99% of all conversations.
We ﬁrst examine the distributions over conversation du-
rations and times between conversations. Let user u have
C conversations in the observation period. Then, for every
conversation i of user u we create a tuple (tsu,i, teu,i, mu,i),
where tsu,i denotes the start time of the conversation, teu,i
is the end time of the conversation, and mu,i is the number
of exchanged messages between the two users. We order the
conversations by their start time (tsu,i < tsu,i+1). Then,
for every user u, we calculate the average conversation du-
ration ¯d(u) = 1
C Pi teu,i − tsu,i, where the sum goes over
all the u’s conversations. Figure 5(a) shows the distribution
of ¯d(u) over all the users u. We ﬁnd that the conversation
length can be described by a heavy-tailed distribution with
exponent -3.7 and a mode of 4 minutes.

Figure 5(b) shows the intervals between consecutive con-
versations of a user. We plot the distribution of tsu,i+1 −
tsu,i, where tsu,i+1 and tsu,i denote start times of two con-
secutive conversations of user u. The power-law exponent of
the distribution over intervals is − 1.5. This result is sim-
ilar to the temporal distribution for other kinds of human
communication activities, e.g., waiting times of emails and
letters before a reply is generated [4]. The exponent can be
explained by a priority-queue model where tasks of diﬀerent

priorities arrive and wait until all tasks with higher priority
are addressed. This model generates a task waiting time
distribution described by a power-law with exponent −1.5.

5. COMMUNICATION DEMOGRAPHICS
Next we examine the interplay of communication and user
demographic attributes, i.e., how geography, location, age,
and gender inﬂuence observed communication patterns.
5.1 Communication by age

We sought to understand how communication among peo-
ple changes with the reported ages of participating users.
Figures 6(a)-(d) use a heat-map visualization to commu-
nicate properties for diﬀerent age–age pairs. The rows and
columns represent the ages of both parties participating, and
the color at each age–age cell captures the logarithm of the
value for the pairing. The color spectrum extends from blue
(low value) through green, yellow, and onto red (the highest
value). Because of potential misreporting at very low and
high ages, we concentrate on users with self-reported ages
that fall between 10 and 60 years.

Let a tuple (ai, bi, di, mi) denote the ith conversation in
the entire dataset that occurred among users of ages ai
and bi. The conversation had a duration of di seconds
during which mi messages were exchanged. Let Ca,b =
{(ai, bi, di, mi) : ai = a ∧ bi = b} denote a set of all con-
versations between users of ages a and b, respectively.

Figure 6(a) shows the number of conversations among peo-
ple of diﬀerent ages. For every pair of ages (a, b) the color
indicates the size of set Ca,b, i.e., the number of diﬀerent
conversations between users of ages a and b. We note that,
as the notion of a conversation is symmetric, the plots are
symmetric. Most conversations occur between people of ages
10 to 20. The diagonal trend indicates that people tend to
talk to people of similar age. This is true especially for age
groups between 10 and 30 years. We shall explore this ob-
servation in more detail in Section 6.

Figure 6(b) displays a heat map for the average conver-
di. We note

serve a similar phenomenon when plotting the average num-
ber of exchanged messages per conversation, computed as

Here, we see that younger people have faster-paced dialogs,
while older people exchange messages at a slower pace.

|Ca,b| Pi∈Ca,b

We note that the younger population (ages 10–35) are
strongly biased towards communicating with people of a
similar age (diagonal trend in Figure 6(a)), and that users
who report being of ages 35 years and above tend to com-
municate more evenly across ages (rectangular pattern in
Fig. 6(a)). Moreover, older people have conversations of the
longest durations, with a “valley” in the duration of conver-
sations for users of ages 25–35. Such a dip may represent
shorter, faster-paced and more intensive conversations asso-
ciated with work-related communications, versus more ex-
tended, slower, and longer interactions associated with social
discourse.

5.2 Communication by gender

We report on analyses of properties of pairwise communi-
cations as a function of the self-reported gender of users in
conversations in Table 1. Let Cg,h = {(gi, hi, di, mi) : gi =
g ∧ hi = h} denote a set of conversations where the two par-
ticipating users are of genders g and h. Note that g takes 3
possible values: female, male, and unknown (unreported).

Table 1(a) relays |Cg,h| for combinations of genders g and
h. The table shows that approximately 50% of conversations
occur between male and female and 40% of the conversations
occur among users of the same gender (20% for each). A
small number of conversations occur between people who
did not reveal their gender.

|Cg,h| Pi∈Cg,h

Similarly, Table 1(b) shows the average conversation length
in seconds, broken down by the gender of conversant, com-
puted as
di. We ﬁnd that male–male conver-
sations tend to be shortest, lasting approximately 4 min-
utes. Female–female conversations last 4.5 minutes on the
average. Female–male conversations have the longest du-
rations, taking more than 5 minutes on average. Beyond
taking place over longer periods of time, more messages are
exchanged in female–male conversations. Table 1(c) lists

values for
mi and shows that, in female–male
conversations, 7.6 messages are exchanged per conversation
on the average as opposed to 6.6 and 5.9 for female–female
and male–male, respectively. Table 1(d) shows the com-
. The
munication intensity computed as
number of messages exchanged per minute of conversation
for male–female conversations is higher at 1.5 messages per
minute than for cross-gender conversations, where the rate
is 1.43 messages per minute.

mi
di

We examined the number of communication ties, where a
tie is established between two people when they exchange
at least one message during the observation period. We
computed 300 million male–male ties, 255 million female–
female ties, and 640 million cross-gender ties. The Mes-
senger population consists of 100 million males and 80 mil-
lion females by self report. These ﬁndings demonstrate that
ties are not heavily gender biased; based on the popula-
tion, random chance predicts 31% male–male, 20% female–
female, and 49% female–male links. We observe 25% male–
male, 21% female–female, and 54% cross-gender links, thus
demonstrating a minor bias of female–male links.

The results reported in Table 1 run counter to prior stud-
ies reporting that communication among individuals who
resemble one other (same gender) occurs more often (see [9]
and references therein). We identiﬁed signiﬁcant heterophily,
where people tend to communicate more with people of the
opposite gender. However, we note that link heterogeneity
was very close to the population value [8], i.e., the number of
same- and cross-gender ties roughly corresponds to random
chance. This shows there is no signiﬁcant bias in linking
for gender. However, we observe that cross-gender conver-
sations tend to be longer and to include more messages,
suggesting that more eﬀort is devoted to conversations with
the opposite sex.
5.3 World geography and communication

We now focus on the inﬂuence of geography and distance
among participants on communications. Figure 7 shows the
geographical locations of Messenger users. The general lo-
cation of the user was obtained via reverse IP lookup. We
plot all latitude/longitude positions linked to the position of
servers where users log into the service. The color of each
dot corresponds to the logarithm of the number of logins
from the respective location, again using a spectrum of col-
ors ranging from blue (low) through green and yellow to red
(high). Although the maps are built solely by plotting these
positions, a recognizable world map is generated. We ﬁnd
that North America, Europe, and Japan are very dense, with
many users from those regions using Messenger. For the rest
of the world, the population of Messenger users appears to
reside largely in coastal regions.

We can condition the densities and behaviors of Messen-
ger users on multiple geographical and socioeconomic vari-
ables and explore relationships between electronic commu-
nications and other attributes. As an example, harnessed
the United Nations gridded world population data to pro-
vide estimates of the number of people living in each cell.
Given this data, and the data from Figure 7, we calculate
the number of users per capita, displayed in Figure 8. Now
we see transformed picture where several sparsely populated
regions stand out as having a high usage per capita. These
regions include the center of the United States, Canada,
Scandinavia, Ireland, Australia, and South Korea.

Figure 7: Number of users at a particular geographic
location. Color of dots represents the number of
users.

Figure 8: Number of Messenger users per capita.
Color intensity corresponds to the number of users
per capita in the cell of the grid.

Figure 9 shows a heat map that represents the intensi-
ties of Messenger communications on an international scale.
To create this map, we place the world map on a ﬁne grid,
where each cell of the grid contains the count of the number
of conversations that pass through that point by increasing
the count of all cells on the straight line between the geo-
locations of pairs of conversants. The color indicates the
number of conversations crossing each point, providing a vi-
sualization of the key ﬂows of communication. For example,
Australia and New Zealand have communications ﬂowing
towards Europe and United States. Similar ﬂows hold for
Japan. We see that Brazilian communications are weighted
toward Europe and Asia. We can also explore the ﬂows of
transatlantic and US transcontinental communications.
5.4 Communication among countries

Communication among people within diﬀerent countries
also varies depending on the locations of conversants. We
examine two such views. Figure 10(a) shows the top coun-
tries by the number of conversations between pairs of coun-
tries. We examined all pairs of countries with more than
10 million conversations per month. The width of edges in
the ﬁgure is proportional to the logarithm of the number of
conversations among the countries. We ﬁnd that the United
States and Spain appear to serve as hubs and that edges
appear largely between historically or ethnically connected
countries. As examples, Spain is connected with the Span-
ish speaking countries in South America, Germany links to
Turkey, Portugal to Brazil, and China to Korea.

Figure 10(b) displays a similar plot where we consider
country pairs by the average duration of conversations. The

versation lengths do not increase with distance (see plots
in [7]). Conversation duration decreases with the distance,
while the number of exchanged messages remains constant
before decreasing slowly. Figure 11(b) shows the commu-
nications per link versus the distance among participants.
The plot shows that longer links, i.e., connections between
people who are farther apart, are more frequently used than
shorter links. We interpret this ﬁnding to mean that peo-
ple who are farther apart use Messenger more frequently to
communicate.

In summary, we observe that the total number of links and
associated conversations decreases with increasing distance
among participants. The same is true for the duration of
conversations, the number of exchanged messages per con-
versation, and the number of exchanged messages per unit
time. However, the number of times a link is used tends
to increase with the distance among users. This suggests
that people who are farther apart tend to converse with IM
more frequently, which perhaps takes the place of more ex-
pensive long-distance voice telephony; voice might be used
more frequently in lieu of IM for less expensive local com-
munications.

6. HOMOPHILY OF COMMUNICATION

We performed several experiments to measure the level
at which people tend to communicate with similar people.
First, we consider all 1.3 billion pairs of people who ex-
changed at least one message in June 2006, and calculate
the similarity of various user demographic attributes. We
contrast this with the similarity of pairs of users selected
via uniform random sampling across 180 million users. We
consider two measures of similarity: the correlation coeﬃ-
cient and the probability that users have the same attribute
value, e.g., that users come from the same countries.

Table 2 compares correlation coeﬃcients of various user
attributes when pairs of users are chosen uniformly at ran-
dom with coeﬃcients for pairs of users who communicate.
We can see that attributes are not correlated for random
pairs of people, but that they are highly correlated for users

conversations between the countries. The core of the net-
work appears to be Arabic countries, including Saudi Ara-
bia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Syria.
5.5 Communication and geographical distance
We were interested in how communications change as the
distance between people increases. We had hypothesized
that the number of conversations would decrease with geo-
graphical distance as users might be doing less coordination
with one another on a daily basis, and where communication
would likely require more eﬀort to coordinate than might
typically be needed for people situated more locally. We
also conjectured that, once initiated, conversations among
people who are farther apart would be somewhat longer as
there might be a stronger need to catch up when the less-
frequent conversations occurred.

Figure 11 plots the relation between communication and
distance. Figure 11(a) shows the distribution of the num-
ber of conversations between conversants at distance l. We
found that the number of conversations decreases with dis-
tance. However, we observe a peak at a distance of approx-
imately 500 kilometers. The other peaks and drops may re-
veal geographical features. For example, a signiﬁcant drop
in communication at distance of 5,000 km (3,500 miles) may
reﬂect the width of the Atlantic ocean or the distance be-
tween the east and west coasts of the United States. The
number of links rapidly decreases with distance. This ﬁnding
suggests that users may use Messenger mainly for communi-
cations with others within a local context and environment.
We found that the number of exchanged messages and con-

who communicate. As we noted earlier, gender and commu-
nication are slightly negatively correlated; people tend to
communicate more with people of the opposite gender.

Another method for identifying association is to measure
the probability that a pair of users will show an exact match
in values of an attribute, i.e., identifying whether two users
come from the same country, speak the same language, etc.
Table 2 shows the results for the probability of users sharing
the same attribute value. We make similar observations as
before. People who communicate are more likely to share
common characteristics, including age, location, language,
and they are less likely to be of the same gender. We note
that the most common attribute of people who communi-
cate is language. On the ﬂip side, the amount of communi-
cation tends to decrease with increasing user dissimilarity.
This relationship is highlighted in Figure 11, which shows
how communication among pairs of people decreases with
distance.

Figure 12 further illustrates the results displayed in Ta-
ble 2, where we randomly sample pairs of users from the
Messenger user base, and then plot the distribution over
reported ages. As most of the population comes from the
age group 10–30, the distribution of random pairs of people
reaches the mode at those ages but there is no correlation.
Figure 12(b) shows the distribution of ages over the pairs
of people who communicate. Note the correlation, as repre-
sented by the diagonal trend on the plot, where people tend
to communicate more with others of a similar age.

Next, we further explore communication patterns by the
diﬀerences in the reported ages among users. Figure 13(a)
plots on a log-linear scale the number of conversations in the
social network with participants of varying age diﬀerences.
Again we see that links and conversations are strongly cor-
related with the age diﬀerences among participants. Fig-
ure 13(b) shows the average conversation duration with the
age diﬀerence among the users. Interestingly, the mean con-

versation duration peaks at an age diﬀerence of 20 years
between participants. We speculate that the peak may cor-
respond roughly to the gap between generations.

The plots reveal that there is strong homophily in the com-
munication network for age; people tend to communicate
more with people of similar reported age. This is especially
salient for the number of buddies and conversations among
people of the same ages. We also observe that the links
between people of similar attributes are used more often,
to interact with shorter and more intense (more exchanged
messages) communications. The intensity of communica-
tion decays linearly with the diﬀerence in age. In contrast
to ﬁndings of previous studies, we observe that the num-
ber of cross-gender communication links follows a random
chance. However, cross-gender communication takes longer
and is faster paced as it seems that people tend to pay more
attention when communicating with the opposite sex.

Recently, using the data we generated, Singla and Richard-
son further investigated the homophily within the Messenger
network and found that people who communicate are also
more likely to search the web for content on similar top-
ics [14].

7. THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK

So far we have examined communication patterns based
on pairwise communications. We now create a more general
communication network from the data. Using this network,
we can examine the typical social distance between people,
i.e., the number of links that separate a random pair of
people. This analysis seeks to understand how many peo-
ple can be reached within certain numbers of hops among
people who communicate. Also, we test the transitivity of
the network, i.e., the degree at which pairs with a common
friend tend to be connected.

We constructed a graph from the set of all two-user con-
versations, where each node corresponds to a person and
there is an undirected edge between a pair of nodes if the
users were engaged in an active conversation during the ob-
servation period (users exchanged at least 1 message). This
results in a network which contains 179,792,538 nodes, and
1,342,246,427 edges. Note that this is not simply a buddy
network; we only connect people who are buddies and have
communicated during the observation period.

Figures 14–15 show the structural properties of the com-
munication network. The network degree distribution shown
in Figure 14(a) is heavy tailed but does not follow a power-
law distribution. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we
ﬁt a power-law with exponential cutoﬀ p(k) ∝ k−ae−bk with
ﬁtted parameter values a = 0.8 and b = 0.03. We found a
strong cutoﬀ parameter and low power-law exponent, sug-
gesting a distribution with high variance.

Figure 14(b) displays the degree distribution of a buddy
graph. We did not have access to the full buddy network;
we only had access to data on the length of the user contact
list which allowed us to create the plot. We found a total
of 9.1 billion buddy edges in the graph with 49 buddies per
user. We ﬁt the data with a power-law distribution with
exponential cutoﬀ and identiﬁed parameters of a = 0.6 and
b = 0.01. The power-law exponent now is even smaller.
This model described the data well. We note a spike at
600 which is the limit on the maximal number of buddies
imposed by the Messenger software client. The maximal
number of buddies was increased to 300 from 150 in March

2005, and was later raised to 600. With the data from June
2006, we see only the peak at 600, and could not identify
bumps at the earlier constraints.

Social networks have been found to be highly transitive,
i.e., people with common friends tend to be friends them-
selves. The clustering coeﬃcient [19] has been used as a
measure of transitivity in the network. The measure is de-
ﬁned as the fraction of triangles around a node of degree
k [19]. Figure 15(a) displays the clustering coeﬃcient ver-
sus the degree of a node for Messenger. Previous results
on measuring the web graph as well as theoretical analyses
show that the clustering coeﬃcient decays as k−1 (exponent
−1) with node degree k [11]. For the Messenger network,
the clustering coeﬃcient decays very slowly with exponent
−0.37 with the degree of a node and the average clustering
coeﬃcient is 0.137. This result suggests that clustering in
the Messenger network is much higher than expected—that
people with common friends also tend to be connected. Fig-
ure 15(b) displays the distribution of the connected compo-
nents in the network. The giant component contains 99.9%
of the nodes in the network against a background of small
components, and the distribution follows a power law.
7.1 How small is the small world?

Messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study
distances in the social network. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst time a planetary-scale social network has been available
to validate the well-known “6 degrees of separation” ﬁnding
by Travers and Milgram [17]. The earlier work employed
a sample of 64 people and found that the average number
of hops for a letter to travel from Nebraska to Boston was
6.2 (mode 5, median 5), which is popularly known as the “6
degrees of separation” among people. We used a population
sample that is more than two million times larger than the
group studied earlier and conﬁrmed the classic ﬁnding.

Figure 16(a) displays the distribution over the shortest
path lengths. To approximate the distribution of the dis-
tances, we randomly sampled 1000 nodes and calculated for
each node the shortest paths to all other nodes. We found
that the distribution of path lengths reaches the mode at
6 hops and has a median at 7. The average path length is
6.6. This result means that a random pair of nodes in the
Messenger network is 6.6 hops apart on the average, which is
half a link longer than the length measured by Travers and
Milgram. The 90th percentile (eﬀective diameter [16]) of the
distribution is 7.8. 48% of nodes can be reached within 6
hops and 78% within 7 hops. So, we might say that, via the
lens provided on the world by Messenger, we ﬁnd that there
are about “7 degrees of separation” among people. We note
that long paths, i.e., nodes that are far apart, exist in the
network; we found paths up to a length of 29.

7.2 Network cores

We further study connectivity of the communication net-
work by examining the k-cores [5] of the graph. The concept
of k-core is a generalization of the giant connected compo-
nent. The k-core of a network is a set of vertices K, where
each vertex in K has at least k edges to other vertices in
K. The distribution of k-core sizes gives us an idea of how
quickly the network shrinks as we move towards the core.

The k-core of a graph can be obtained by deleting from
the network all vertices of degree less than k. This process
will decrease degrees of some non-deleted vertices, so more
vertices will have degree less than k. We keep pruning ver-
tices until all remaining vertices have degree of at least k.
We call the remaining vertices a k-core.

Figure 16 plots the number of nodes in a core of order
k. We note that the core sizes are remarkably stable up to
a value of k ≈ 20; the number of nodes in the core drops
for only an order of magnitude. After k > 20, the core
size rapidly drops. The central part of the communication
network is composed of 79 nodes, where each of them has
more than 68 edges inside the set. The structure of the
Messenger communication network is quite diﬀerent from
the Internet graph; it has been observed [2] that the size of
a k-core of the Internet decays as a power-law with k. Here
we see that the core sizes remains very stable up to a degree
≈ 20, and only then start to rapidly degrease. This means
that the nodes with degrees of less than 20 are on the fringe
of the network, and that the core starts to rapidly decrease
as nodes of degree 20 or more are deleted.

922WWW 2008 / Alternate Track: Industrial Practice and ExperienceApril 21-25, 2008 · Beijing, China7.3 Strength of the ties

It has been observed by Albert et al. [1] that many real-
world networks are robust to node-level changes or attacks.
Researchers have showed that networks like the World Wide
Web, Internet, and several social networks display a high
degree of robustness to random node removals, i.e., one has
to remove many nodes chosen uniformly at random to make
the network disconnected. On the contrary, targeted attacks
are very eﬀective. Removing a few high degree nodes can
have a dramatic inﬂuence on the connectivity of a network.
Let us now study how the Messenger communication net-
work is decomposed when “strong,” i.e., heavily used, edges
are removed from the network. We consider several diﬀerent
deﬁnitions of “heavily used,” and measure the types of edges
that are most important for network connectivity. We note
that a similar experiment was performed by Shi et al [13]
in the context of a small IM buddy network. The authors
of the prior study took the number of common friends at
the ends of an edge as a measure of the link strength. As
the number of edges here is too large (1.3 billion) to remove
edges one by one, we employed the following procedure: We
order the nodes by decreasing value per a measure of the
intensity of engagement of users; we then delete nodes as-
sociated with users in order of decreasing measure and we
observe the evolution of the properties of the communication
network as nodes are deleted.

We consider the following diﬀerent measures of engage-

ment:

• Average sent: The average number of sent messages

per user’s conversation

• Average time: The average duration of user’s conver-

sations

• Links: The number of links of a user (node degree),
i.e., number of diﬀerent people he or she exchanged
messages with

• Conversations: The total number of conversations of a

user in the observation period

• Sent messages: The total number of sent messages by

a user in the observation period

• Sent per unit time: The number of sent messages per

unit time of a conversation

• Total time: The total conversation time of a user in

the observation period

At each step of the experiment, we remove 10 million
nodes in order of the speciﬁc measure of engagement being
studied. We then determine the relative size of the largest
connected component, i.e., given the network at particu-
lar step, we ﬁnd the fraction of the nodes belonging to the
largest connected component of the network.

Figure 17 plots the evolution of the fraction of nodes in
the largest connected component with the number of deleted
nodes. We plot a separate curve for each of the seven dif-
ferent measures of engagement. For comparison, we also
consider the random deletion of the nodes.

The decomposition procedure highlighted two types of dy-
namics of network change with node removal. The size of the
largest component decreases rapidly when we use as mea-
sures of engagement the number of links, number of conver-
sations, total conversation time, or number of sent messages.
In contrast, the size of the largest component decreases very
slowly when we use as a measure of engagement the average

time per conversation, average number of sent messages, or
number of sent messages per unit time. We were not sur-
prised to ﬁnd that the size of the largest component size de-
creases most rapidly when nodes are deleted in order of the
decreasing number of links that they have, i.e., the number
of people with whom a user at a node communicates. Ran-
dom ordering of the nodes shrinks the component at the
slowest rate. After removing 160 million out of 180 million
nodes with the random policy, the largest component still
contains about half of the nodes. Surprisingly, when deleting
up to 100 million nodes, the average time per conversation
measure shrinks the component even more slowly than the
random deletion policy.

Figure 18 displays plots of the number of removed edges
from the network as nodes are deleted. Similar to the rela-
tionships in Figure 17, we found that deleting nodes by the
inverse number of edges removes edges the fastest. As in
Figure 18, the same group of node ordering criteria (num-
ber of conversations, total conversation time or number of
sent messages) removes edges from the networks as fast as
the number of links criteria. However, we ﬁnd that ran-
dom node removal removes edges in a linear manner. Edges
are removed at a lower rate when deleting nodes by aver-
age time per conversation, average numbers of sent mes-
sages, or numbers of sent messages per unit time. We be-

conversations and many messages per conversation tend to
have smaller degrees—even given the ﬁndings displayed in
Figure 17, where we saw that removing these users is more
eﬀective for breaking the connectivity of the network than
for random node deletion. Figure 18 also shows that using
the average number of messages per conversation as a crite-
rion removes edges in the slowest manner. We believe that
this makes sense intuitively: If users invest similar amounts
of time to interacting with others, then people with short
conversations will tend to converse with more people in a
given amount of time than users having long conversations.

8. CONCLUSION

We have reviewed a set of results stemming from the gen-
eration and analysis of an anonymized dataset representing
the communication patterns of all people using a popular
IM system. The methods and ﬁndings highlight the value of
using a large IM network as a worldwide lens onto aggregate
human behavior.

We described the creation of the dataset, capturing high-
level communication activities and demographics in June
2006. The core dataset contains more than 30 billion conver-
sations among 240 million people. We discussed the creation
and analysis of a communication graph from the data con-
taining 180 million nodes and 1.3 billion edges. The commu-
nication network is largest social network analyzed to date.
The planetary-scale network allowed us to explore dependen-
cies among user demographics, communication characteris-
tics, and network structure. Working with such a massive
dataset allowed us to test hypotheses such as the average
chain of separation among people across the entire world.

We discovered that the graph is well connected, highly
transitive, and robust. We reviewed the inﬂuence of multi-
ple factors on communication frequency and duration. We
found strong inﬂuences of homophily in activities, where
people with similar characteristics tend to communicate more,
with the exception of gender, where we found that cross-
gender conversations are both more frequent and of longer
duration than conversations with users of the same reported
gender. We also examined the path lengths and validated
on a planetary scale earlier research that found “6 degrees
of separation” among people.

We note that the sheer size of the data limits the kinds
of analyses one can perform. In some cases, a smaller ran-
dom sample may avoid the challenges with working with
terabytes of data. However, it is known that sampling can
corrupt the structural properties of networks, such as the de-
gree distribution and the diameter of the graphs [15]. Thus,
while sampling may be valuable for managing complexity
of analyses, results on network properties with partial data
sets may be rendered unreliable. Furthermore, we need to
consider the full data set to reliably measure the patterns of
age and distance homophily in communications.

In other directions of research with the dataset, we have
pursued the use of machine learning and inference to learn
predictive models that can forecast such properties as com-
munication frequencies and durations of conversations among
people as a function of the structural and demographic at-
tributes of conversants. Our future directions for research
include gaining an understanding of the dynamics of the
structure of the communication network via a study of the
evolution of the network over time.

We hope that our studies with Messenger data serves as
an example of directions in social science research, highlight-
ing how communication systems can provide insights about
high-level patterns and relationships in human communica-
tions without making incursions into the privacy of individ-
uals. We hope that this ﬁrst eﬀort to understand a social
network on a genuinely planetary scale will embolden others
to explore human behavior at large scales.
