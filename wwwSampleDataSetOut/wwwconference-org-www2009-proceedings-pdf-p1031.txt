ABSTRACT
E-commerce is growing at an exponential rate. In the last
decade, there has been an explosion of online commercial
activity enabled by World Wide Web (WWW). These days,
many consumers are less attracted to online auctions, pre-
ferring to buy merchandise quickly using ﬁxed-price nego-
tiations. Sales at Amazon.com, the leader in online sales
of ﬁxed-price goods, rose 37% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008.
At eBay, where auctions make up 58% of the site’s sales,
revenue rose 14%. In Brazil, probably by cultural inﬂuence,
online auctions are not been popular. This work presents a
characterization and analysis of ﬁxed-price online negotia-
tions. Using actual data from a Brazilian marketplace, we
analyze seller practices, considering seller proﬁles and strate-
gies. We show that diﬀerent sellers adopt strategies accord-
ing to their interests, abilities and experience. Moreover,
we conﬁrm that choosing a selling strategy is not simple,
since it is important to consider the seller’s characteristics
to evaluate the applicability of a strategy. The work also
provides a comparative analysis of some selling practices in
Brazil with popular worldwide marketplaces.

INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, there has been an explosion of online
commercial activity enabled by the Internet and World Wide
Web (WWW). Electronic marketplaces, such as Amazon [1]
and eBay [12], have reached great popularity and revenue,
emerging as one of the most relevant scenarios of Business-
to-Consumer (B2C) and Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-
commerce models. This scenario combines characteristics

from conventional retail market with Web technologies, es-
tablishing a new dimension of the world economy that has
not been well understood yet [7].

An electronic marketplace (or electronic market system)
is an interorganizational information system that allows the
participating buyers and sellers to exchange information about
prices and product oﬀerings [6]. E-markets provide an elec-
tronic or online method to facilitate transactions between
buyers and sellers that potentially provides support for all
steps in the order fulﬁllment process.

In this rich and complex scenario of e-markets, thousands
of players trade billions of dollars,
interacting with each
other to buy and sell products, exchange information and
knowledge, establishing diﬀerent kinds of relationships. One
of the biggest challenges in online marketplaces is the under-
standing of the complex mechanism that guides the results
of the negotiation.
In order to address this challenge, it
is essential to assess how the negotiation (oﬀer) inputs are
correlated to the outcomes.

Previous work has focused on analyzing how diﬀerent in-
put factors are related to the success of the auction, the
ending price, and the attraction of bidders [3, 8]. However,
identifying consistent and robust correlation patterns, which
represents part of the selling practices, is a challenge. In this
context, we call a correlation pattern a frequent behavior ob-
served between some seller and oﬀer characteristics (inputs)
and negotiation outcomes (outputs). An example would be
the relation between the seller’s reputation and the reached
sale’s volume.

In the context of electronic markets, there are important
factors that can be considered to analyze selling practices,
such as the seller’s reputation and experience, oﬀer’s price,
duration, among others. Understanding how these factors
aﬀect the auction results is useful for buyers, sellers and e-
market’s provider. The buyers may choose to negotiate with
more trustable sellers and save money. On the other hand,
the sellers can make decisions that increase the chances of
achieving success in the negotiation or to sell faster. Finally,
the marketplace can provide speciﬁc services that will help
buyers and sellers, increasing its popularity and revenues.

In this paper we follow a methodology to characterize
ﬁxed-price online negotiations. We are interested in de-
termining and analyzing the selling practices in a Brazil-
ian marketplace. Negotiation inputs are divided into: (1)
seller characteristics and (2) oﬀer conﬁguration, that con-
tains product characteristics. By characterizing seller’s at-
tributes we may identify seller proﬁles.
In a similar way,

mine selling strategies. We will explain better the concept
of seller proﬁle and seller strategies in Section 4.

Besides identifying and analyzing selling practices, we are
speciﬁcally interested in investigating 2 hypotheses: (1) Seller
proﬁles choose diﬀerent strategies to conﬁgure their oﬀers;
(2) the impact of the selling strategy on negotiation results
depends on the seller proﬁle.

We are going to investigate these hypotheses because they
address important questions about sellers and their practices
in online marketplaces and previous work have not already
provided enough information to study them. We are going to
test these hypotheses by performing a characterization and
analysis of a real case study. Our results can be applied to
provide support decision strategies for sellers in e-markets.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 discusses some related work. Section 3 presents an
overview of TodaOferta marketplace. Section 4 describes
a complete case study and its analysis using actual data
from this marketplace. In Section 5 we present an impor-
tant discussion about the results. Finally, Section 6 shows
our conclusion and future work.

2. RELATED WORK

Electronic markets are becoming more popular each day.
One of the most common e-market application is online auc-
tions, which have been studied extensively lately. Many
studies focus on validating concepts from the classic eco-
nomic theory of auctions in the online environment. For
example, Lucking-Reiley [19] checks the validity of the well-
known results of revenue equivalence. Bajari and Hortacsu [5]
address how the starting bid, set by the seller, aﬀects the
winner’s course. Gilkeson and Reynolds [13] show the im-
portance of a proper starting bid price to attract more bid-
ders and make an auction successful.

Studies about sellers have focused on reputation systems
and trust in online auctions. Some of them have analyzed
the importance of reputation in auction outputs, mainly on
ﬁnal prices. In [4], the authors investigate the eﬀectiveness
of reputation systems and how reputation correlates to auc-
tion results. They conclude that reputation plays an impor-
tant role in trust and leads to higher ending prices. In [18],
is analyzed the eﬀect of trust and reputation on the proﬁts
obtained by intermediaries in electronic commercial connec-
tions. Diﬀerent trust and distrust propagation schemes in
e-commerce negotiations are studied and evaluated in [14].
Resnick et al. [21] show that sellers with high reputation
are more capable to sell their products, but the gains in ﬁnal
prices are reduced. Using a controlled experiment, Resnick
et al. [22] study more accurately the reputation’s impact
on the auction outputs. The results show that, in general,
bidders pay higher prices to sellers with higher reputation.
Becherer and Halstead [8] sent e-mail questionnaires to some
sellers of eBay. Using factor analysis they study seller pro-
ﬁles and selling strategies, showing the diversity of sellers
and business practices on eBay.

There are speciﬁc works that deal with selling strategies.
However, in general these works evaluate online auctions.
In [3] the authors analyze the interrelationships between dif-
ferent variables of the auction, using correlation coeﬃcients,
for sales of the Palm Vx on eBay. They categorize sellers
by their negotiation frequency during data collection. Sell-
ers with high amount of sales are deﬁned as retailers. The

results show that retailers who set low starting bids attract
more bids than any other type of seller. Moreover, they
found out that sellers with high reputation are more able to
describe their products.

Buy-it-now prices (BIN) have become increasingly popu-
lar among buyers and sellers. Several empirical papers have
studied the Buy-it-now option on eBay. For example, in [11]
and [2], it has been found that experienced sellers use the
BIN price more frequently and that BIN price oﬀers of sell-
ers with a high reputation are accepted more frequently.
In [24], they focus on the consequences of bidder risk aver-
sion on seller revenue. They ﬁnd that the buy-now auction
raises seller revenue even if the buy price is not accepted at
the auction open by any bidder type.

To the best of our knowledge, there is not any speciﬁc work
that analyzes the selling practices for a ﬁxed-price market-
place in an Ibero-American country, as we do in this work.

3. MARKETPLACE DESCRIPTION

This section describes TodaOferta1, which is a new mar-
ketplace from the largest Latin America Internet Service
Provider, named Universo OnLine Inc. (UOL)2.

Today, with more than 12 years of history and a faith-
ful audience in constant ampliﬁcation, UOL is synonymous
with Internet in Brazil.
It provides access in more than
3,000 Brazilian localities, connection in more than 100,000
places in more than 150 nations overseas and it has about
1.7 million subscribers.

At UOL Shopping, an intelligent search compares prod-
ucts’ prices on the Internet. UOL Shopping hosts a super-
market, bookstores, CD and computer stores, and car sales.
In two new fronts, UOL products motivate and speed up the
electronic trade in the country: UOL PagSeguro, launched
in June 2007, is an online Brazilian payment solution that
allows users to trade with safe; TodaOferta, oﬃcially started
in August 2007, allows anyone to buy and sell through the
Internet in a direct, fast, and secure way. At TodaOferta,
buyers and vendors can talk freely.

Table 1 shows a short summary of the TodaOferta dataset.
It embeds a signiﬁcant sample of users, oﬀers, and negotia-
tions. Due to a conﬁdentiality agreement, these ﬁgures can
not be presented, although they were used in our research.
We consider active users in our analysis, that is, users who
have negotiated (bought or sold) at least one item at To-
daOferta using ﬁxed-price.

There are 32 top-level categories, which include 2189 sub-
categories, in TodaOferta, which provide a variety of distinct
products, from collectibles to electronic and vehicles. The
current top5 negotiated products are cell phones, MP3 play-
ers, courses, digital cameras, and consoles (games).

After each negotiation, buyers and sellers qualify each other
with a rate of value 1 (positive), 0 (neutral), or -1 (negative).
User’s reputation is deﬁned as the sum of all qualiﬁcations
received by him/her. To avoid cheating by the creation of
fake users to provide several positive feedback’s to a given
user, TodaOferta considers only unique feedback’s in the cal-
culation of users’ reputation score.

The next section presents our characterization of selling

practices using real data from TodaOferta.

4. CHARACTERIZATION AND ANALYSIS
This section presents our characterization of TodaOferta
through the application of a methodology that we have pre-
viously used in eBay [23]. We aim to characterize this mar-
ketplace, which was described in Section 3, distinguishing
the sellers from their selling strategies. Moreover, we are in-
terested in testing the two aforementioned hypotheses pre-
viously presented about sellers and their selling strategies.
In order to achieve this goal, our methodology is based on
two key points:

1. Instead of identifying correlations among inputs and
outputs, we propose to ﬁrst identify signiﬁcant pat-
terns among the inputs and then to correlate these
patterns with the negotiation outcomes.

2. Since some inputs may have diﬀerent roles (e.g., seller
characteristics as qualiﬁcation, oﬀer details as descrip-
tion of the product being negotiated), it is necessary
to group them into separate sets and consider each set
separately to identify meaningful patterns.

The next subsections describe our characterization of To-

daOferta.
4.1

Identifying Negotiation Inputs

First we have to identify the inputs that will be part of

the characterization process.

The set of variables that aﬀects the negotiation results
can be large and varied. Thus, understanding how these
variables are correlated with the negotiation results is a
complex task. To deal with this complexity, we distinguish
the negotiation inputs according to their characteristics and
functionalities, dividing them into seller’s characteristics and
oﬀer conﬁguration.

(cid:129) Seller’s characteristics: the inputs related to the
seller provide information about the person who is will-
ing to sell the product. An e-market can provide a
variety of information about the seller, such as its en-
rollment (registration) date on the system, a reputa-
tion measure, or a forum where buyers would comment
their experiences with such seller.

(cid:129) Oﬀer conﬁguration: the set of variables directly re-
lated to a given product being negotiated, such as the
price, the state (new or used) and the number of pic-
tures about the product. Diﬀerently from seller infor-
mation, the oﬀer conﬁguration is a free choice of the
seller. Sellers may become experts on generating at-
tractive conﬁgurations for their product’s oﬀer, while
other sellers may face diﬃculties during this task, due
to lack of experience, available time or interest. A

speciﬁc part of the oﬀer conﬁguration is the product
information.

The set of seller’s characteristics leads to the identiﬁcation
of seller proﬁles, which will be explained in Section 4.4. In
addition, oﬀer conﬁguration analysis results in the identiﬁ-
cation of selling strategies, which will be explained in Sec-
tion 4.5.

In the next subsections we describe the selected inputs for

seller and oﬀer conﬁguration.

4.1.1

Seller’s characteristics

We deﬁne a set of meaningful information about sellers

provided by TodaOferta:

(cid:129) Retailer: indicates whether the seller is considered a

participant that sells high volume of products.

(cid:129) Certiﬁed: denotes the seller who has a quality certi-
ﬁcation. This certiﬁcation is provided by a third party
company to guarantee the idoneity.

(cid:129) Qualiﬁcation: indicates the seller reputation rating.
For every transaction that takes place in TodaOferta,
buyers and sellers have the opportunity to rate each
other by leaving a feedback. Each feedback consists of
a positive, negative, or neutral rating, as well as a brief
comment left by the buyer or the seller. Feedback rat-
ings are cumulative, adding points to the participant’s
score. TodaOferta considers only unique feedbacks in
order to compute the score. The attribute Qualiﬁca-
tion refers to the unique feedback’s score.

(cid:129) Time: how long the seller has been registered in the
e-market. Remembering TodaOferta was launched in
June of 2007, we have more than one year of data.

(cid:129) Items: it is the amount of items the seller has already

sold in the e-market.

4.1.2 Offer Conﬁguration

We choose the following attributes to characterize the oﬀer

conﬁguration in TodaOferta:

(cid:129) Highlight:

indicates when the oﬀer is set to be ad-

vertised with highlight.

(cid:129) Price: is the price the product has been oﬀered.
(cid:129) Duration: negotiation duration (in days).
(cid:129) Images: number of pictures used by the seller to present

the product he wants to sell.

(cid:129) Quantity: the number of items in the oﬀer.
Identifying Negotiation Outcomes

4.2

After identifying the inputs of interest, it is necessary to
deﬁne the negotiation outcomes that will be evaluated. Dif-
ferent outcomes may be selected according to the goals of
the characterization. Examples of outcomes are the price
obtained for the product being traded, the success of the
transaction (qualiﬁcation), and the time that has been spent
to sell the item.

These negotiation outcomes can be seen as success indi-

cators. We choose ﬁve indicators, as follows:

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1033(cid:129) Price (P): the value of the performed transaction.
(cid:129) Volume (V): the number of oﬀer’s items that has

been sold.

(cid:129) Views: the number of visualizations (visits) the oﬀer

has achieved.

(cid:129) Qualiﬁcation (Q): is the transaction rating given by
the buyer to the seller. As previously explained, each
feedback consists of a positive, negative, or neutral rat-
ing.

(cid:129) Duration (D): the amount of time spent since the
oﬀer was created until the negotiation has occurred.

4.3 Data Engineering

We pre-process the data to improve the quality of the
characterization results. A small number of oﬀers with in-
consistent data and outliers were removed from the dataset.
It is also important to say that we consider in this analysis
only oﬀers that have negotiations.

Employing clustering techniques on attributes with skewed
distributions may result on low quality clusters, as the dif-
ference between the values may not be representative. For
example, the probability distribution of the oﬀer’s prices
shows that there are huge variations in these values and also
a skewed behavior in the distribution of values. To address
this problem, we consider prices of each product category.
Moreover, to set the same weight to all the attributes we
normalized them in the interval (0,1).

4.4

Identifying Seller Proﬁles

The identiﬁcation of seller proﬁles is based on the seller’s
characteristics. In order to identify seller proﬁles and selling
strategies, we employ a data mining technique called clus-
tering [9], which can be used to identify clusters (groups)
with similar characteristics in terms of their attributes.

Many clustering algorithms have been proposed by lit-
erature [10, 17].
It is very important to choose the best
algorithm based on the dataset characteristics (i.e., dimen-
sionality, number of transactions). We employ X-means[20],
which is an eﬃcient algorithm that extends the popular K-
means [15] by estimating the best number of clusters k inher-
ent to the data. It adopts the concept of centroid, which is
an imaginary point that has the average properties of a given
cluster, so we can use it to represent that cluster. We test
diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the algorithm in order to identify
the best number of clusters, considering the tradeoﬀ between
similarity and error reduction.

We use statistical metrics, such as the average, median
and dispersion metrics (standard deviation, co-variance) to
analyze the characteristics of each proﬁle. Determining seller
proﬁles can help us understanding better the results achieved
by the selling strategies.

As an example, suppose we identify a given seller pro-
ﬁle Pa, which exhibits high reputation and has been selling
products for a long period. Sellers that present this proﬁle
may obtain a success rate higher than others of another hy-
pothetical proﬁle Pb, which presents low reputation and is
composed by newcomers. We could infer possible reasons for
a higher success rate for Pa as the impact of their reputation
and experience.

In order to identify seller proﬁles we executed the x-means
algorithm for diﬀerent values of k on the seller attributes.
The best value found for k (number of clusters) was 16.

Table 3 describes each seller proﬁle, presenting the clus-
ter’s frequency (the number in parenthesis), and the char-
acterization in terms of the seller characteristics, previously
explained: Retailer, Certiﬁed, Qualiﬁcation, Time, Items.

For the boolean values (Retailer and Certiﬁed), we adopt
the labels Y (yes) or N (no). For the other characteristics,
in order to simplify the analysis, we classify each of them
according to the mean value (and considering standard de-
viation) to a scale (very low, low, average, high, very high).
We also adopt a special notation to present these classes in
the tables, as explained in Table 2.

Table 3: Seller Proﬁle - Clusters

This notation will be also used in selling strategies charac-
terization analysis. We will then explain soon seller proﬁles,
choosing the most frequent ones, due to lack of space.
(cid:129) P13: sellers who are neither a retailer or a certiﬁed
participant. They have low reputation, are newcomers
and present a very low amount of sales. This seller
proﬁle represents 34.72% of TodaOferta players.

(cid:129) P14: retailers without certiﬁcation, that have an av-
erage reputation value, a short registration time and a
small number of sales. This group occurs in 13.34%.
(cid:129) P5: group of sellers who are neither a retailer or a
certiﬁed participant, with average reputation. They
are newcomers with very small amount of items sold.
This proﬁle occurs 10.05%.

(cid:129) P4: this seller proﬁle is similar to P5, except that
it represents sellers that are not newcomers, besides
having a short registration time in the e-market.
It
occurs 6.6%.

(cid:129) P3: this group of seller proﬁle is similar to P4, except
it has a small number of items sold, which is higher
than P4. It occurs in 6.57%.

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1034It is important to emphasize that together they represent
more than 70% of the seller that negotiate in this e-market
and are sellers with reputation varying from the lowest to the
average values. Thus, we are going to talk about one more
proﬁle, choosing one with good reputation, P6, which occurs
in 5.17%. Sellers from P6 are considered retailers with ex-
perience in terms of negotiation time, with high reputation
and average volume of sales in the given e-market.

Table 4 shows the success indicators for each seller proﬁle.
These indicators (Price, Volume, Views, Qualiﬁcation, Du-
ration) have already been described. We perform an Anal-
ysis of Variance (ANOVA), which is a statistical method
used to compare two or more means. The results conﬁrm
that these indicators are statistically diﬀerent.

Table 4: Seller Proﬁle - Success Indicators

For sake of providing more details about seller proﬁle, we
are going to deepen in the analysis of seller proﬁles and
outcomes. It is interesting to observe that the most frequent
proﬁles do not present the same success indicators.

In terms of price (considering the price normalized for
each product category), we can see that these seller pro-
ﬁles present the same classiﬁcation - average (Price = (cid:129)).
In terms of sale’s volume, P13, P4 and P5 show an aver-
age value. P14 and P6 present a low value and P3, a high
volume. However, it is important to explain that this indi-
cator can not be analyzed in isolation, since it is important
to know the amount of items that were oﬀered and also to
compare the indicator with the Price indicator. Consider-
ing the amount of visualizations the oﬀer has achieved, P13
and P4 have low value. P3 and P5 present an average value
of visits. P6 has a high number of visits and P14, a very
high. Observe that it is not possible to explain these behav-
iors without analyzing how these seller proﬁles conﬁgurate
their oﬀers. The qualiﬁcations of the negotiations performed
by P14, P5, P4 and P3 are high. P13 presents an average
qualiﬁcation to its negotiation and P6, a very high. The
Duration, which represents how fast the sale occurs, is on
average for P13, P5, P4 and P3. For P14, the Duration is
high, and low for P6.

The analysis of success indicators for each seller proﬁle
shows the diﬀerent proﬁles achieve diﬀerent results. How-
ever, this analysis does not provide enough details to verify
the two hypotheses presented in Section 1. Despite this, it
is possible to formulate some preliminary conclusions:

(cid:129) There are a small number of retailers in TodaOferta,

who perform 25.2% of the TodaOferta negotiations.

(cid:129) There are a small number of certiﬁed sellers in To-
daOferta and they perform a small percentage of sales
(4.76%). Considering that P15 is also a retailer, the ex-
clusive certiﬁed seller (P12) participates in only 0.32%
of negotiations.

(cid:129) Newcomers correspond to 47.02% of all completed trans-
actions in the e-market. This fact also has a direct
relation to the fact that TodaOferta has been growing
each day.

The next subsection presents the characterization of sell-

ing strategies.
4.5

Identifying Selling Strategies

Selling strategies are identiﬁed by grouping the set of in-
puts related to oﬀer conﬁguration. In order to identify the
selling strategies, we also execute x-means algorithm and the
best value found for the number of clusters was 15.

Table 5 presents each selling strategy, showing the clus-
ter’s frequency (the number in parenthesis), and their char-
acterization in terms of the attributes previously explained:
Highlight, Price, Duration, Images and Quantity.

Table 5: Seller Strategy - Clusters

Analogously to the seller proﬁle analysis, we present an
explanation of the selling strategies, choosing, due to lack of
space, the most frequent ones.

(cid:129) S6: Oﬀers with highlighted advertisement, average
values of price and duration, low number of product
images and low quantity of items. This is the most
frequent selling strategy, corresponding to 12.83%.

(cid:129) S9: group of oﬀers that does not have special adver-
tisement, with very low price and duration. Also, these
oﬀers present a very small number of images and quan-
tity of items. They represent 11.88% of the performed
transactions of TodaOferta.

(cid:129) S11: Oﬀers that are similar to S9 in terms of Highlight
and product Images. However, their prices are low,
have an average duration and quantity of items. This
cluster occurs 11.41%.

(cid:129) S0: set of oﬀers with similar conﬁguration to S6 in
terms of Highlight, Price and Duration. These of-
fers present a very high number of images and average
quantity of items. 10.12% of TodaOferta transactions
follow this strategy.

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1035(cid:129) S3: group of oﬀers that does not have Highlight. Their
prices and durations are low. They provide an average
number of product images and very low quantity of
oﬀered items. This cluster corresponds to 9.37%.

As can be seen, each selling strategy has its own pecu-
liarities, besides the similar characteristics. These ﬁve most
popular strategies correspond to 55.61% of all negotiations
from TodaOferta. It is also important to say that used items
exist only in oﬀers from S8. Moreover, used items occur only
in approximately 5% of all negotiations from TodaOferta.

Table 6 shows the success indicators for each selling strat-
egy. These indicators (Volume, Views, Qualiﬁcation, Du-
ration) have already been described. We omit the Price
indicator, since it is also an input of each oﬀer, therefore we
have already explained it in last analysis of the clusters. We
also perform an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), conﬁrm-
ing that the success indicators of the groups are statistically
diﬀerent.

Table 6: Seller Strategy - Success Indicators

From the analysis of the success indicators of selling strate-
gies, we can see that the most frequent strategies do not
present the same success indicators, as can be observed from
the analysis of Tables 5 and 6.

In terms of sale’s volume, that consider the relative amount
of items sold compared to the number of items oﬀered, S9
has a very high value and the other four clusters are on av-
erage. Considering the number of visits to oﬀer’s ad, S0 and
S6 have a high value. S3 and S11 present a low value and
S9, a very low one.
In terms of the transaction qualiﬁca-
tion, that is made by the buyer after negotiation, S0 and
S6 achieve a very high value. S3 and S11 have an average
qualiﬁcation and S9, a low one. Considering the time spent
to eﬀectivate the transaction (between publishing the oﬀer
and conﬁrming the negotiation), S0, S6 and S11 spend an
average time to do it. S3 has a low value of Duration and
S9, a very low.

From the analysis of selling strategies applied to oﬀers
in TodaOferta, it is possible to identify some preliminary
conclusions, as follows:

(cid:129) Oﬀers with Highlight do not necessarily sell a high vol-
ume of items, since the volume depends on the amount
of oﬀered items. Using Highlight is an eﬃcient mecha-
nism to attract visits, as can be observed by the success
indicator Views. A highlighted oﬀer is not a condition
to sell faster.

(cid:129) It is interesting to note that the transactions with
the best qualiﬁcations are the ones which oﬀers have
adopted the Highlight option. One explanation to this
observation can be the fact that a highlighted oﬀer has
more visits, but also this raise the responsibility of its
success. As an example, see S0 and S2.

(cid:129) Oﬀers with lower average prices (e.g., S2) would at-
tract more visitors, however this behavior was observed
only for the ones which also pay to be highlighted.

(cid:129) We can observe a direct correlation between the oﬀer
Duration (Seller Strategy input) and Duration as a
success indicator (meaning the time to sell), except for
cluster S8.

(cid:129) There is not a direct correlation between Quantity in-
put (number of oﬀered items) and Volume (success in-
dicator, which represents the percentage of items sold
considering the oﬀered amount).

(cid:129) Diﬀerent from what could be expected, a lower value
for the price of an oﬀer do not determine a lower time
to sell (the same conclusion is valid for a higher value).
(cid:129) The number of images used in oﬀer’s description does
not present a direct correlation to the transaction qual-
iﬁcation.

These conclusions suggest how complex these e-market’s
interactions are, showing the importance and relevance of
this kind of research. In order to test the two hypotheses
of this work (see Section 1), it will be necessary to correlate
the seller proﬁles and selling strategies.

In the next section we will present and analyze the cor-
relation between seller proﬁle and selling strategies, which
deﬁnes the seller practice, and also we will address some im-
portant characteristics that can be observed in this Brazilian
marketplace in contrast to what has already been published
about some popular international marketplace leaders.

5. DISCUSSION

This section presents a discussion about the seller prac-
tices, showing details about the correlation between seller
proﬁles and selling strategies. Moreover, in Section 5.2, we
describe a comparative analysis of our research results and
other conclusions from important studies about worldwide
marketplaces, such as Amazon [1] and eBay [12].
5.1 Analysis of Selling Practices

In this section we present the seller practices in TodaOferta.
As described in Section 4, there are 16 seller proﬁles and
15 selling strategies. A seller practice can be deﬁned as the
selling strategy adopted by a seller proﬁle. In potential, con-
sidering the Cartesian product, there would have 240 selling
practices, however 198 diﬀerent selling practices actually oc-
cur in TodaOferta.

Our ﬁrst hypothesis to address states that “Seller pro-
ﬁles choose diﬀerent strategies to conﬁgure their oﬀers.” We
are going to identify which selling strategies (S0 − S14) are
adopted by each seller proﬁle (P 0 − P 15). It is important
to evaluate whether the same seller proﬁle adopts or not the
same selling strategies.

Figure 1 shows an histogram of the selling strategies used
by the most frequent seller proﬁles, which were previously

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1036described. P13, which is the most popular seller proﬁle, uses
the following selling strategies, in order of frequency: S11,
S3, S12, S5 and S0. Analyzing the results, it is possible to see
that diﬀerent selling strategies (with diﬀerent proportions)
are adopted by diﬀerent seller proﬁles.

Figure 1: Distribution of Seller Strategies

These previous analysis test our ﬁrst hypothesis, conﬁrm-

ing that sellers apply diﬀerent strategies.

The second hypothesis states that “The impact of the sell-
ing strategy on negotiation results depends on the seller pro-
ﬁle.” A given selling strategy may be eﬀective to lead to
good results for some proﬁles, but not to others. In order to
test it, we will perform a more detailed analysis of the seller
practices.

We are going to analyze these selling practices, analyzing
how these combinations of seller proﬁles and selling strate-
gies aﬀect the negotiation outcomes. As there are so many
diﬀerent practices, we decide to present the analysis of the
best and worst practices, considering diﬀerent aspects. We
deﬁne the following dimensions to analyze (we omit the
explanations of isolated indicators, as we have already ex-
plained them - Volume, Qualiﬁcation, Duration, Price and
Views):

(cid:129) Price * Volume: represents a relationship between the
sale’s price and volume.
It is important since there
exists a tradeoﬀ between selling more expensive and
selling more items.

(cid:129) Volume / Views: indicates how eﬀective is the number

of visits to an oﬀer in terms of sale’s volume.

(cid:129) Qualiﬁcation * Price: provides a measure that corre-
lates the transaction qualiﬁcation considering the of-
fer’s price.

(cid:129) Duration * Price: measures a relation between the

time to sell and the sale’s price.

We assume the same weights for these four combined suc-

cess indicators.

Table 7 shows the top5 best and worst selling practices,
considering Volume, Qualiﬁcation and Duration, and these
four dimensions that we have just described. We classify the
practice as best or worst considering how it performs accord-
ing to each of these dimensions. For example, as higher the
Volume or Qualiﬁcation as better; as lower the Duration as
better; as higher the Volume per Views as better. Next we
explain these practices according to each dimension.

Table 7: Best and Worst Selling Practices

Volume: the best practice is P9-S9. P9 is the group of
sellers with very high registration time and they sell many
items. S9 is a strategy which applies very low prices, without
highlight, with very small duration and quantity per oﬀer.
These aspects explain why this practice is the best, consid-
ering only the Volume criterion. The second best practice is
P11-S4. P11 are newcomers with average qualiﬁcation that
sell average amount of items per oﬀer. They do not sell a
high volume of items in general. However, using S4 strategy,
which oﬀers low amount of items, an average price, low dura-
tion and many images to describe the product, they achieve
a good Volume of sales. Analyzing the worst practices in
this criterion, we can see P0-S11. P0 are retailers, with very
good reputation, average time of registration and sell many
items. However, by adopting a strategy of using none or few
images to describe the oﬀer and an average amount of items,
they do not achieve success in terms of sale’s volume.

Qualiﬁcation: the two best practices are P9-S9 and P6-
S4. The ﬁrst strategy, which we have already explained in
the last analysis, is strange because it consists of older sellers
with average reputation, selling very fast and cheap without
resources (Retailer, Quality Certiﬁcation, Oﬀer Highlight).
We suspect this practice is a test or anomalous behavior in
the e-market, which motivates us to better investigate this
proﬁle. P6-S4 consists of retailers with good reputation and
experience, oﬀering small amount of items with many im-
ages and average price. Despite the strategy S4 is not very
good in general, it becomes a good strategy in terms of this
criterion when adopted by P6. Considering the worst prac-
tices, it is interesting to note the proﬁles P2, P7 and P11

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1037represent new sellers with transactions with bad qualiﬁca-
tions, what becomes determinant to those results, despite
some selling strategies adopted are good in general.

Duration: P9 is indicated by four best practices, as ex-
pected by its characteristics. P1-S13 is a good practice for
this criterion.
It is interesting to note that S13 is not a
good strategy for this aspect, however it is a good option
in terms of Qualiﬁcation, Price and Volume. Despite this,
when used by P1, which are seller with average experience
that sell much, it becomes a good strategy to sell fast and
with a very good Price * Volume tradeoﬀ, as we see in the
next dimension analysis. Considering the worst practices,
we can see strategies S5, S12, S14, which all of them set
a long or very long duration for their oﬀers, are listed. S5
and S12 do not use Highlight to give distinction to their of-
fers and achieve bad qualiﬁcation for their transactions. S14
adopts Highlight, however is adopted by P15, who is a re-
tailer, certiﬁed and get high prices with good qualiﬁcation,
besides sells a few amount of items and attract few buyers
to its oﬀers.

Price * Volume:

it deals with proﬁt, since the idea is
to maximize this relation. The practice P1-S13 achieves a
good result, joining a proﬁle who sells much with low prices
with a strategy that applies a high price and small quantity.
S1 is a strategy that achieves good results in this analysis, it
applies very high prices to sell very low quantities, probably
a unique item, what justiﬁes this result. P9, P1 and P4
achieve good results when using S1. Considering the worst
practices, we identify that P0-S1 is not good because P0
achieves average price and volume, in general, since is a
group of retailers who oﬀers many items. S8 is not a good
strategy for this criterion when adopted by seller of P1 and
P9 who set the cheapest prices in TodaOferta.

Volume/Views: the strategies S1, S8 and S13 domi-
nate, since they provide good results in terms of Volume
with small number of Views and good qualiﬁcation. Con-
sidering the worst practices, we identify that P0-S1 is not
good because P0 are retailers who oﬀer many items (average
sale’s volume). S2 appears many times as the worst practices
because it uses Highlight (achieving a huge number views),
however with a small sale’s volume, since it oﬀers also a huge
amount of items.

Qualiﬁcation * Price: S1 is the best practice when it
is adopted by P0, P3, P15, P8 and P4, proﬁles with high
or average reputation. It is interesting to note this strategy
is one worst practice when adopted by P7, which represents
newcomers that achieve low prices with very low transac-
tion qualiﬁcation. Observe that P7 dominates the worst
practices, together with P2, which is a proﬁle with similar
success indicators for price and qualiﬁcation.

Duration * Price: S1 is also the best practice, when it is
adopted by P14, P13, P15, P5 and P12, proﬁles with average
or low (P13) reputation. This is explained by the fact that
this strategy achieves a very high price in average time to
sell. The worst practices are the ones who are applied by P1
and P9, who set a very low price to their oﬀers.

As previously explained, we decide to investigate with
more details the seller proﬁle P9.
It occurs 2864 times,
99.5% adopting the S9 strategy. This seller proﬁle consists
of a mature seller in terms of registration time, with av-
erage reputation, which sells very fast and cheap without
resources (Retailer, Quality Certiﬁcation, Oﬀer Highlight).
As suspected, these 2864 negotiations are performed by an

unique person with ridiculous price, suggesting it would be
a testing or fake proﬁle.

The analysis of these best and worst seller practices con-
ﬁrm our second hypothesis, which states that the eﬀect of
the selling strategy on negotiation results depends on the
seller proﬁle. A given selling strategy (e.g., S4) may be ef-
fective in terms of qualiﬁcation when used by P6, but it is
not when adopted by P7 or P11. Another example is S1 that
is a good strategy in terms of Volume per Views when prac-
ticed by P1, but it is not for P0. The same strategy S1 is
the best one when considering Duration * Price, however it
produces a bad result when applied by seller from P9. More-
over, this analysis led us to a better comprehension about
how complex is to qualify the practices, since it depends on
the criterion used as target. Therefore, a support decision
system to recommend seller practices should consider that
the seller ﬁrst has to rank with weights the importance of
each criterion she/he wants to consider.

Table 8 shows the ten most frequent selling practices per-
formed in TodaOferta. These practices correspond to 31.78%
of all negotiation practices. For each of them, it is presented
the success indicators to analyze the practices, the same that
were previously explained.

Table 8: Most Popular Selling Practices

As can be seen, the two most popular seller practices (P13-
S11 and P13-S3) achieve bad indicators in terms of Qualiﬁ-
cation (low), Price * Volume (low) and Qualiﬁcation * Price
(low).

The third popular practice (P14-S6) is good because it
achieves a high qualiﬁcation with average values for the
other dimensions, such as Price * Volume, except for Volume
per Views (V/Views).

As expected, the seller proﬁle P13 dominates the most
popular practices, since it corresponds to 34.72% of all pro-
ﬁles. The same is observed for selling strategy S9, which is
the most frequent one.

From this analysis we can conclude that the most pop-
ular seller practices performed in TodaOferta are not good
practices, in general. This conclusion motivates to develop
mechanisms to provide decision support tools to help sellers
recommending practices them. Moreover, it is important
to emphasize, according to the hypotheses we tested in this
work, that the best practices should be personalized, since
the eﬀect of the selling strategy on negotiation results de-
pends on the seller proﬁle.
5.2 Comparative Analysis with other world-

wide marketplaces

This section presents an analysis about our electronic mar-
ketplace in Brazil, based on TodaOferta - this new market-
place from UOL, which is the largest Latin America Inter-

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track: WWW in lbero-America 1038net Service Provider - and about famous worldwide market-
places, such as Amazon [1] and eBay [12]. Our objective
is to show a comparative analysis about selling practices in
Brazil with these most popular marketplaces. Brazil is the
ﬁfth largest world’s population3 and tenth largest world’s
economy4 (largest in Latin American and second largest in
Ibero American). It is important to say that this analysis is
restrict to the public information available in the Web.

5.2.1 Auction versus Fixed-price

A recent article from Business Week [16] addresses the
adoption of dynamic (auction) versus ﬁxed-price in online
markets. According to the article, as the business of buying
and selling over the Internet has matured, the thrill and
novelty of auctions have given way to the convenience of
one-click purchases.

Auctions were once a pillar of e-commerce. People didn’t

simply shop on eBay. They hunted, they fought, they sweated,
they won. These days, consumers are less attracted to auc-
tions, preferring to buy stuﬀ quickly at a ﬁxed price. Sales at
Amazon.com, the leader in online sales of ﬁxed-price goods,
rose 37% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008. At eBay, where auc-
tions make up 58% of the site’s sales, revenue rose 14%.

In Brazil, probably by cultural inﬂuence, online auctions
have not been popular. Only to exemplify, in TodaOferta
marketplace the percentage of ﬁxed-price negotiations cor-
responds to 98.2%. Besides the signiﬁcant trend to raise the
ﬁxed-price negotiation in international e-markets, such as
eBay, we can observe that Brazilian online customers have
a completely diﬀerent behavior.

eBay’s ”Buy It Now” business, where shoppers can pur-
chase items at a set price even when the merchandise is also
listed in an auction, makes up 42% of all goods sold on eBay.
It’s growing at an annual 22% pace, the fastest among eBay’s
shopping businesses. At the current pace, this may be the
ﬁrst year that eBay generates more revenue from ﬁxed-price
sales than from auctions [16].

5.2.2 Retailer Practices

Considering the sellers who sell a high volume of prod-
ucts, called Retailers, there are some interesting research
conclusions about worldwide marketplaces.

Anderson et al. [3], analyzing an eBay dataset, observed
that seller ratings are higher for retailers than for the rest
of the seller proﬁles, which follows from our discussion of
how TodaOfertaˆa ˘A ´Zs seller reputation favor more frequent
sellers.

5.2.3 Newcomer Sellers

Another important analysis address how a newcomer seller
usually behaves. Also in [3], the authors found out that the
eBay marketplace has a large number of newcomer sellers,
with heterogeneous characteristics who tried a wide range
of strategies. In particular, these sellers did not follow the
strategies of retailers, even if they present similar character-
istics (such as having a high seller rating), and the product
that they were selling was also similar to those being sold
by retailers (for example, being new).

Considering this aspect, our research achieves a similar
conclusion. The newest sellers of TodaOferta try a variety of
selling strategies. For example, the seller proﬁles P5 and P13

adopt all strategies in a well-distributed manner. Moreover,
we observe that the newcomers from TodaOferta present dif-
ferent characteristics and distinct success indicators in their
negotiations.

5.2.4 Quantity of Offered Items

In terms of the amount of oﬀered items, Anderson et. al [2]
showed that the “Buy it Now” option was used more often
by sellers with higher ratings (awarded by previous buyers)
and oﬀering fewer units. In our investigation, we found a
diﬀerent result.

Analyzing the three most qualiﬁed seller proﬁles (P0, P2
and P6), we did not ﬁnd a typical correlation between the
quantity of oﬀered items and their reputation ratings. For
example, P0 has oﬀers with low and average amount of
items, while P6 presents very high, average and low amount
of oﬀered items in distinct selling strategies adopted.

5.2.5 Qualiﬁed Sellers

One important aspect to analyze is how seller reputation
rating aﬀects the negotiation outcomes, such as ﬁnal prices.
Anderson et. al [2] focus their empirical analysis on the
determinants of the sellerˆa ˘A´Zs choice of whether to use a
“Buy it Now” option, which allows a buyer to essentially
bypass the entire auction process. This option can be seen
as the ﬁxed-price strategy available in eBay. They conclude
that seller reputation, as measured by eBay, did not appear
as signiﬁcant in determining the ﬁnal price as expected.

Diﬀerent from their conclusions, in our research we found
out that reputation rating has a signiﬁcant impact on ne-
gotiation outcomes, however this fact can not be analyzed
separately, since we have veriﬁed that the selling strategy
has a crucial impact on the outcomes (e.g., ﬁnal price), not
just the qualiﬁcation of the seller proﬁle. One example of
this importance can be conﬁrmed by the P0 proﬁle when
adopting the S1 strategy, which is considered the best sell-
ing practice in the criterion that considers qualiﬁcation and
price (see Table 7).

6. CONCLUSION

This paper presents a characterization of a ﬁxed-price on-
line negotiations, using actual data from TodaOferta. We
analyze the seller practices in this Brazilian marketplace,
considering seller proﬁles and selling strategies. More than
identifying and analyzing seller practices, we investigate two
hypotheses. The ﬁrst hypothesis states that seller proﬁles
choose diﬀerent strategies to conﬁgure their oﬀers. And the
second one says that the impact of the selling strategy on
negotiation results depends on the seller proﬁle. We test
these two hypotheses, conﬁrming they are true for this real
e-market scenario.

The validation of the ﬁrst hypothesis shows that the seller
behavior is not random, that is, diﬀerent sellers adopt their
strategies according to their interests, capacities and expe-
rience. The second hypothesis suggests that choosing a sell-
ing strategy is not simple, since it is important to consider
the seller’s characteristics to evaluate the applicability of a
strategy. Moreover, it indicates the importance of recom-
mendation services in order to provide a support decision
tool to select a proper conﬁguration set for the negotiation.
There are some interesting conclusions we were able to
conﬁrm from the characterization. Some of them are: (i)
There are a small number of retailers in TodaOferta and

(25.2%); (ii) The newcomers correspond to 47.02% of all
complete transactions in the e-market. This fact also has a
direct relation to the fact that TodaOferta has been grow-
ing each day; (iii) Oﬀers with Highlight do not necessarily
sell a high volume of items, since the volume depends on
the amount of oﬀered items. Using Highlight is an eﬃcient
mechanism to attract visits, as can be observed by the suc-
cess indicator Views. A Highlight oﬀer is not a condition
to sell faster. These conclusions illustrate how complex are
this e-market interactions, showing the importance and rel-
evance of this kind of research.

We also provide a comparative analysis about selling prac-
tices in Brazil with famous worldwide popular marketplaces,
such as eBay [12] and Amazon [1]. We analyze interesting
aspects, such as the use of auction versus ﬁxed-price, the
retailer practices, newcomer seller practices, and how rep-
utation rating aﬀects the negotiation outcomes. There are
similar and distinct conclusions about these analyses.

As future work we are going to investigate with more de-
tails the selling practices, considering the top product cat-
egories. We plan to perform a similar characterization to
oﬀers that do not result in sale, comparing the results with
the ones obtained in this work. Moreover, we want to charac-
terize the buyer proﬁles, investigating the buying practices.
The current and future results can be applied to develop
mechanisms to provide decision support tools to recommend
negotiation practices to sellers and buyers.
