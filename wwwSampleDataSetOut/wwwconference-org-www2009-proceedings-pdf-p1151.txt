ABSTRACT
Automatic compilation of lexicon is a dream of lexicon com-
pilers as well as lexicon users. This paper proposes a system
that crawls English-Japanese person-name transliterations
from the Web, which works a back-end collector for auto-
matic compilation of bilingual person-name lexicon. Our
crawler collected 561K transliterations in Ô¨Åve months. From
them, an English-Japanese person-name lexicon with 406K
entries has been compiled by an automatic post processing.
This lexicon is much larger than other similar resources in-
cluding English-Japanese lexicon of HeiNER obtained from
Wikipedia.

INTRODUCTION

Frequent update and enhancement of lexicon is always
welcomed by lexicon users. However, lexicons are rarely up-
dated because it requires a lot of human labor. A solution
is replacement of human labor with a computer program.
Automatic compilation of lexicon is a dream of lexicon com-
pilers as well as lexicon users.

In this paper, we report an attempt of automatic compi-
lation of a bilingual lexicon from the Web. We have selected
English-Japanese (Latin-Katakana) person-name lexicon as
a target of automatic compilation because of the following
reasons.

1. Between languages that use diÔ¨Äerent alphabets, per-
son name translation is a serious problem for human
translators.
In English-Japanese translation, person

names written in Latin script are transliterated into
one in Katakana script according to their pronuncia-
tions. English-Japanese transliteration of person name
is diÔ¨Écult because of several reasons, such as limited
coverage of existing bilingual lexicons, non-English (e.g.,
French and German) person names appeared in En-
glish texts, and spelling variants in Katakana script.

2. There is a possibility that we can compile a large English-

Japanese person-name lexicon from the Web, because
a lot of transliteration instances of person names exist
on the Web. Actually, human translators use the Web
as a virtual low-quality bilingual lexicon.

3. New person names are produced; new person-name
transliterations are produced in every day. Human
translators hope frequent update of bilingual person-
name lexicon.

This paper proposes a system that crawls English-Japanese
person-name transliterations from the Web, which works
as a back-end collector for automatic lexicon compilation.
From collected transliterations, a bilingual person-name lex-
icon is produced by an automatic post processing. This at-
tempt of automatic lexicon compilation can be viewed as a
conversion from a virtual low-quality bilingual lexicon (i.e.,
the Web) to a real high-quality bilingual lexicon.

2. SYSTEM

Figure 1 shows an overview of the system, Tsumugi Crawler.

The system consists of four components: (1) person-name
pool, which keeps monolingual (English or Japanese) person
names to be searched. (2) Tsumugi Finder, which searches
transliterations (or back-transliterations) of a monolingual
(3) PN-Ô¨Ålter, a person-name Ô¨Ålter, which
person name.
(4) transliteration
selects person-names from candidates.
database, which keeps collected transliteration pairs.

The central component of the system is the Tsumugi Finder.

First, the Finder picks a monolingual person name from the
person-name pool, and sends it to Yahoo Japan!‚Äôs search en-
gine and obtains the search results (100 snippets in Japanese).
Because Japanese texts frequently include partially bilingual
texts, as Nagata et al.[2] reported, it is highly expected that
the obtained snippets include (back-)transliterations of the
person name of the search query.

From the obtained snippets, S-Ô¨Ålter extracts strings that
satisfy a predeÔ¨Åned style requirement of person name. We
have deÔ¨Åned a person name as a term that consists of a Ô¨Årst

name and a last name, and optionally a middle name. The
style requirement is implemented by two regular expressions:
one for English, the other for Japanese.

T-Ô¨Ålter checks transliteration correspondence between the
person name (input) and every candidate produced by S-
Ô¨Ålter. T-Ô¨Ålter uses transliteration score between an English
term and a Japanese term [3], which is an estimated pro-
nunciation similarity of two terms. T-Ô¨Ålter removes a hope-
less candidates whose score is less than the predetermined
threshold.

R-Ô¨Ålter sorts remaining candidates based on their frequen-
cies in the snippets. It always passes the Ô¨Årst-ranked can-
didates; it also passes a few hopeful candidates as spelling
variants of the Ô¨Årst-ranked candidate. Finally, the obtained
transliteration pairs are stored into the transliteration database.

The snippets obtained in the above process are also used
as a source from which the system collects new monolingual
person names. Monolingual person names are obtained by
applying PN-Ô¨Ålter [1] to the candidates produced by S-Ô¨Ålter
and they are stored into the person-name pool.

3. COMPILED LEXICON

Tsumugi Crawler collected 561K transliterations in Ô¨Åve
months run. The Ô¨Ånal bilingual lexicon was produced by
the following post processing.

1. Applying the newest version of S-Ô¨Ålter and T-Ô¨Ålter to

the collected transliterations. (561K ‚Üí 558K)

2. Assign a forward rank and a backward rank to each
transliteration. The forward rank of a transliteration
pair ti = (cid:3)en, jai(cid:4) is a rank among the competitive
ti; the rank is determined by the estimated fre-
set

[

i

quency calculated from the hit counts of ‚Äúen and jai‚Äù.
When ti is in the Ô¨Årst rank, jai is the best (frequently
used) transliteration of en. A backward rank is calcu-
lated by the same way but reverse direction.

3. Select transliterations in the following types and Ô¨Ålter

out other transliterations. (558K ‚Üí 454K)

Type-1 (standard transliteration) transliteration
that has the Ô¨Årst forward rank and the Ô¨Årst back-
ward rank.

Type-2 (transliteration variant) transliteration that

has the Ô¨Årst forward rank or the Ô¨Årst backward
rank (except type-1).

4. Filter out every transliteration whose estimated fre-

quency is 0. (454K ‚Üí 441K)

5. Apply the newest version of PN-Ô¨Ålter to the remaining

transliterations. (441K ‚Üí 406K)

The size of the produced lexicon is 406,416 (type-1 entries
= 286,047, type-2 entries = 120,369; English spellings =
316,259, Japanese spellings = 379,504).

Typical size of existing book-style English-Japanese person-

name dictionary is around 20,000. HeiNER[4] provides bilin-
gual lexicon of named entities, which was compiled from
inter-language links of Wikipedia. The size of English-Japanese
lexicon of HeiNER is 125,053, which includes other types
of name entities such as place, product, and company. The
size of the largest database of English-Japanese person-name
that we know is 175,000, which is sold by a database com-
pany. Our lexicon is much larger than these existing re-
sources.

Because of the large size, evaluation of our lexicon is diÔ¨É-
cult and time-consuming. We have conducted a preliminary
evaluation of precision, where 420 type-1 entries have been
examined by a human evaluator. We have obtained the re-
sult that 390 (93%) entries are correct and 30 (7%) entries
are incorrect (they are correct transliteration pairs of other
types of named entities).

Evaluation of recall of our lexicon is much diÔ¨Écult because
we do not know the total size of English-Japanese person-
name transliterations on the Web. We have conducted a
rough estimation by using a set of known transliterations ex-
tracted from four English books and their Japanese transla-
tions. Among 658 known transliterations that can be found
by Yahoo Japan!‚Äôs search engine, 431 (65.5%) translitera-
tions have been already recorded in our lexicon.
