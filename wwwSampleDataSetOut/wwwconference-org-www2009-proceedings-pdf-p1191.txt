INTRODUCTION

A video sharing service allows “user generated” video clips
to be uploaded, and users of the service can view, rate, and
comment on uploaded videos. Prior work has focused mostly
on the YouTube video sharing service [1,2]. While YouTube
is arguably the most popular video sharing service, studying
the workload characteristics of other video sharing services,
and identifying invariant properties as well as signiﬁcant dif-
ferences, is an important step towards building a broader
understanding of this type of service.

With the aforementioned objective, we collected traces
from four video sharing services: Dailymotion, Yahoo! video,
Veoh, and Metacafe. Dailymotion is France’s leading video
sharing service and caters mostly to French-speaking demo-
graphics, while Yahoo! video, Veoh, and Metacafe are US-
based services. While all four host user generated video
clips, Veoh, in addition, also serves content from major stu-
dios and independent production houses, and utilizes peer-
to-peer technology to distribute longer videos. Metacafe is
distinctive among these services in its use of a revenue shar-
ing model in which content creators are paid for videos that
exceed a certain threshold of views. These services cover a
spectrum of possibilities in the realm of video sharing.

2. SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS

Our key contributions are summarized below:

- We present and analyze workload data from four video
sharing services. In aggregate, our traces contain meta-
data on 1.8 million videos which together acquired
more than 6 billion views.

- We identify seven key invariants of these workloads,
concerning aspects such as the video popularity distri-
bution, use of social and interactive features, and the
uploading of new content.

- We also ﬁnd some signiﬁcant diﬀerences across these
services. For example, while the number of video up-

loads by users follows the Pareto principle, the fraction
of multi-time uploaders is almost two times larger with
Veoh (65%) than with Yahoo (33%).

- We show that video popularity can be measured in dif-
ferent ways and argue that one commonly used metric,
speciﬁcally the number of views a video has received
since it was uploaded, may not be appropriate when
studying issues such as potential for caching. We de-
ﬁne alternative metrics for quantifying video popular-
ity that may be appropriate for such purposes.

For a complete description of our measurement methodology
and a discussion of the above results we refer to our full
paper [3]. Here we brieﬂy describe invariants pertaining to
video popularity.

3. VIDEO POPULARITY

We distinguish between two diﬀerent measures of popu-
larity that have diﬀering applications: the total number of
views to videos since they were uploaded, referred to here
as the total views popularity, and the rate with which videos
accumulate new views, referred to here as the viewing rate
popularity.

The total views popularity distribution is useful for un-
derstanding service features such as “all time” most popular
listings, but does not provide an accurate picture of the dis-
tribution of the rates at which videos are viewed. The latter
is very important when attempting to model the video refer-
ence process, and in understanding the potential of diﬀerent
content distribution and caching architectures. For exam-
ple, with the total views popularity metric, an older video
with many views in the past may appear to be more popular
than a recently uploaded video (and, erroneously, a better
caching candidate) simply because the newer video has not
been available for enough time to acquire more views.

We note that the viewing rate is highly non-stationary. To
measure the viewing rate popularity, i.e., the rate with which
videos accumulate views, we measure the average rate over
some particular time period. One approach to obtaining
such a measure for a site is to crawl the site multiple times.
With two crawls, the (average) viewing rate popularity of a
video can be obtained as the increase in the number of total
views between the two crawls, divided by the time between
the measurements.
In the absence of at least two crawls,
another measure of (average) viewing rate popularity can be
obtained using the average viewing rate since upload, which
we deﬁne as the number of views received since a video was

uploaded divided by the current age of the video at the time
of the crawl. This latter measure removes, to some extent,
the age bias in the total views popularity measure.
3.1 The 80-20 Rule for Video Popularity

We consider how skewed references are to the most popu-
lar videos. Figure 1(a) shows the cumulative distribution of
the total views popularity. Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative
distribution for the viewing rate popularity of the videos, us-
ing the two measures described above. For all three metrics,
the Pareto principle holds for video views. Speciﬁcally:

- Both the total number of views to videos, and the rate
with which new views occur, follow the Pareto rule,
with 20% of the most popular videos accounting for
80% or more of the views.

Similar observations regarding the number of views since
upload [1] and the viewing rate [2] have been made for
YouTube. We note, however, that the Metacafe service ap-
pears to exhibit signiﬁcantly more skew than the other ser-
vices we considered.
3.2 Zipf and Power Law Analysis

Power law is often used to describe phenomena in which
“large” events are uncommon while “small” events occur fre-
quently. A random variable X is said to follow a power law
if P [X ≥ x] is approximately Cxα−1, where both C and α
are constants; the parameter α is the scaling exponent of
the distribution. Presence of a straight line on a comple-
mentary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) plot over
several orders of magnitude when a logarithmic scale is used
on both axes indicates power law scaling.

Figure 2(a) shows the CCDF plot for the total number
of views since a video was uploaded (i.e., the total views
popularity) for each of our data sets. Visual inspection of the
graph suggests that the total views popularity distribution
may have power law behavior over a portion of its range.
For Metacafe, for example, power law behavior appears to
exist for life-time views in excess of 100, with a drop-oﬀ for
the hotest videos.

Figure 2(b) shows the best ﬁt power law, power law with
exponential cut oﬀ, and lognormal distributions, for total
views popularity as measured for the Dailymotion data set.
It is often diﬃcult to distinguish among the mathematical
distributions that we consider in this graph, with respect
to their goodness-of-ﬁt to measured data. For example, the
lognormal distribution can also exhibit a near straight line in
the right tail of the CCDF plot when there is high variance
in the distribution [4].

Using the likelihood ratio test [4], we compared power law
ﬁts with power law plus exponential cut oﬀ and lognormal
ﬁts. For Yahoo! video and Metacafe the comparison in-
dicates that a pure power law is a better model, while for
Dailymotion and Veoh we ﬁnd that both power law with
exponential cut oﬀ and lognormal distributions provide bet-
ter ﬁts. Table 1 presents the power law exponent α along
with the minimum value of x for which power law or power
law with cut oﬀ behavior holds for the data sets; the expo-
nent ranges between 1.43 and 2.25, and is consistent with
prior observations for YouTube’s science and entertainment
videos [1]. To summarize:

- The total views popularity distribution is heavy-tailed
and may be modelled as power law or power law with
exponential cut oﬀ, with power law exponent between
1.4 and 2.3. However, we note that neither a power
law (or variants), nor a lognormal distribution, appear
to ﬁt the entire distribution well.

While the details of our analysis of the viewing rate pop-
ularity distributions are omitted we note that the average
viewing rate since upload is generally more Zipf-like (or
power law) than the total views popularity distribution.
(While we have two snapshots only for the Dailymotion data
set, we note that the average viewing rate for that two week
period is even more Zipf-like than the average viewing rate
since upload.) Furthermore, the viewing rate popularity dis-
tribution of videos can be modelled as power law with cut
oﬀ, with power law exponent between 1.4 and 2.
