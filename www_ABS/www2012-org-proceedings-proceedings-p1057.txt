in the light of the web 2.0 movement, web-based collaboration tools such as google docs have become mainstream and in the meantime serve millions of users. apart from established collaborative web applications, numerous web editors lack multi-user support even though they are suitable for collaborative work. enhancing these single-user editors with shared editing capabilities is a costly endeavor since the implementation of a collaboration infrastructure (accommodating con ict resolution, document synchronization, etc.) is required. in this paper, we present a generic transformation approach capable of converting single-user web editors into multi-user editors. since our approach only requires the con guration of a generic collaboration infrastructure (gci), the e ort to inject shared editing support is significantly reduced in contrast to conventional implementation approaches neglecting reuse. we also report on experimental results of a user study showing that converted editors meet user requirements with respect to software and collaboration qualities. moreover, we de ne the characteristics that editors must adhere to in order to leverage the gci.
