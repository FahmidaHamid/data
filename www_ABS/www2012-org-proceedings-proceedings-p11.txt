the aim of a web-based recommender system is to provide highly accurate and up-to-date recommendations to its users; in practice, it will hope to retain its users over time. however, this raises unique challenges. to achieve complex goals such as keeping the recommender model up-to-date over time, we need to consider a number of external requirements. generally, these requirements arise from the physical nature of the system, for instance the available computational resources. ideally, we would like to design a system that does not deviate from the required outcome. modeling such a system over time requires to describe the internal dynamics as a combination of the underlying rec-ommender model and the its users  behavior. we propose to solve this problem by applying the principles of modern control theory a powerful set of tools to deal with dynamical systems to construct and maintain a stable and robust rec-ommender system for dynamically evolving environments. in particular, we introduce a design principle by focusing on the dynamic relationship between the recommender system s performance and the number of new training samples the system requires. this enables us to automate the control other external factors such as the system s update frequency. we show that, by using a proportional-integral-derivative controller, a recommender system is able to automatically and accurately estimate the required input to keep the output close to a pre-de ned requirements. our experiments on a standard rating dataset show that, by using a feedback loop between system performance and training, the trade-o  between the e ectiveness and e ciency of the system can be well maintained. we close by discussing the widespread applicability of our approach to a variety of scenarios that recommender systems face.
