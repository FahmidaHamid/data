searching over heterogeneous structured data on the web is challenging due to vocabulary and structure mismatches among di erent data sources. in this paper, we study two existing strategies and present a new approach to integrate additional data sources into the search process. the  rst strategy relies on data integration to mediate mismatches through upfront computation of mappings, based on which queries are rewritten to  t individual sources. the other extreme is keyword search, which does not require any upfront investment, but ignores structure information. building on these strategies, we present a hybrid approach, which combines the advantages of both. our approach does not require any upfront data integration, but also leverages the  ne grained structure of the underlying data. for a structured query adhering to the vocabulary of just one source, the so-called seed query, we construct an entity relevance model (erm), which captures the content and the structure of the seed query results. this erm is then aligned on the  y with keyword search results retrieved from other sources and also used to rank these results. the outcome of our experiments using large-scale real-world data sets suggests that data integration leads to higher search e ective-ness compared to keyword search and that our new hybrid approach consistently exceeds both strategies.
