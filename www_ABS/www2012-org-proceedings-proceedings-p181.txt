in many instances, o ensive comments on the internet attract a disproportionate number of positive ratings from highly biased users. this results in an undesirable scenario where these o ensive comments are the top rated ones. in this paper, we develop semi-supervised learning techniques to correct the bias in user ratings of comments. our scheme uses a small number of comment labels in conjunction with user rating information to iteratively compute user bias and unbiased ratings for unlabeled comments. we show that the running time of each iteration is linear in the number of ratings, and the system converges to a unique  xed point. to select the comments to label, we devise an active learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization. our active learning method incrementally updates the risk for neighboring comments each time a comment is labeled, and thus can easily scale to large comment datasets. on real-life comments from yahoo! news, our semi-supervised and active learning algorithms achieve higher accuracy than simple baselines, with few labeled examples.
