consumers  purchase decisions are increasingly in uenced by user-generated online reviews [3]. accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting deceptive opinion spam ctitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader [15]. but while this practice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively little is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online review communities, and less still about the factors that in uence it. we propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with a deception classi er [15], we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six popular online review communities expedia, hotels.com, orbitz, priceline, tripadvisor, and yelp. we additionally propose a theoretical model of online reviews based on economic signaling theory [18], in which consumer reviews diminish the inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting as a signal to a product s true, unknown quality. we  nd that deceptive opinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with di erent growth rates across communities. these rates, we argue, are driven by the di erent signaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g., posting requirements. when measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,  ltering reviews written by  rst-time reviewers, deception prevalence is e ectively reduced.
