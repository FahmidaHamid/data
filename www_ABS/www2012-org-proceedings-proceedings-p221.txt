over the years, private  le-sharing communities built on the bittorrent protocol have developed their own policies and mechanisms for motivating members to share content and contribute resources. by requiring members to maintain a minimum ratio between uploads and downloads, private communities e ectively establish credit systems, and with them full edged economies. we report on a half-year-long measurement study of dime   a community for sharing live concert recordings   that sheds light on the economic forces a ecting users in such communities. a key observation is that while the download of  les is priced only according to the size of the  le, the rate of return for seeding new  les is signi cantly greater than for seeding old  les. we  nd via a natural experiment that users react to such di erences in resale value by preferentially consuming older  les during a  free leech  period. we consider implications of these  nding on a user s ability to earn credits and meet ratio enforce-ments, focusing in particular on the relationship between visitation frequency and wealth and on low bandwidth users. we then share details from an interview with dime moderators, which highlights the goals of the community based on which we make suggestions for possible improvement.
