discovering similar users with respect to their habits plays an important role in a wide range of applications, such as collaborative  ltering for recommendation, user segmentation for market analysis, etc. recently, the progressing ability to sense user contexts of smart mobile devices makes it possible to discover mobile users with similar habits by mining their habits from their mobile devices. however, though some researchers have proposed e ective methods for mining user habits such as behavior pattern mining, how to leverage the mined results for discovering similar users remains less explored. to this end, we propose a novel approach for conquering the sparseness of behavior pattern space and thus make it possible to discover similar mobile users with respect to their habits by leveraging behavior pattern mining. to be speci c,  rst, we normalize the raw context log of each user by transforming the location-based context data and user interaction records to more general representations. second, we take advantage of a constraint-based bayesian matrix factorization model for extracting the latent common habits among behavior patterns and then transforming behavior pattern vectors to the vectors of mined common habits which are in a much more dense space. the experiments conducted on real data sets show that our approach outperforms three baselines in terms of the e ectiveness of discovering similar mobile users with respect to their habits.
