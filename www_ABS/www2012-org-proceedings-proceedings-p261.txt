researchers and social observers have both believed that hashtags, as a new type of organizational objects of information, play a dual role in online microblogging communities (e.g., twitter). on one hand, a hashtag serves as a bookmark of content, which links tweets with similar topics; on the other hand, a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community membership, which bridges a virtual community of users. are the real users aware of this dual role of hashtags? is the dual role a ecting their behavior of adopting a hashtag? is hashtag adoption predictable? we take the initiative to investigate and quantify the e ects of the dual role on hashtag adoption. we propose comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of how a user selects content tags as well as joins communities. experiments using large scale twitter datasets prove the e ectiveness of the dual role, where both the content measures and the community measures signi cantly correlate to hashtag adoption on twitter. with these measures as features, a machine learning model can e ectively predict the future adoption of hashtags that a user has never used before.
