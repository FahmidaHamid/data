this paper presents an automatic method for understanding and interpreting the semantics of unannotated web images. we observe that the relations between objects in an image carry important semantics about the image. to capture and describe such semantics, we propose object relation network (orn), a graph model representing the most probable meaning of the objects and their relations in an image. guided and constrained by an ontology, orn transfers the rich semantics in the ontology to image objects and the relations between them, while maintaining semantic consistency (e.g., a soccer player can kick a soccer ball, but cannot ride it). we present an automatic system which takes a raw image as input and creates an orn based on image visual appearance and the guide ontology. we demonstrate various useful web applications enabled by orns, such as automatic image tagging, automatic image description generation, and image search by image.
