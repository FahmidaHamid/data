the distribution of passwords chosen by users has implications for site security, password-handling algorithms and even how users are permitted to select passwords. using password lists from four di erent web sites, we investigate if zipf s law is a good description of the frequency with which passwords are chosen. we use a number of standard statistics, which measure the security of password distributions, to see if modelling the data using a simple distribution is e ective. we then consider how much the password distributions from each site have in common, using password cracking as a metric. this shows that these distributions have enough high-frequency passwords in common to provide e ective speedups for cracking passwords. finally, as an alternative to a deterministic banned list, we will show how to stochastically shape the distribution of passwords, by occasionally asking users to choose a di erent password.
