mobile browser is known to be slow because of the bottleneck in resource loading. client-only solutions to improve resource loading are attractive because they are immediately deployable, scala-ble, and secure. we present the first publicly known treatment of client-only  solutions  to  understand  how  much  they  can  improve mobile browser speed without infrastructure support. leveraging an unprecedented set of web usage data collected from 24 iphone users  continuously  over  one  year,  we  examine  the  three  fundamental,  orthogonal  approaches  a  client-only  solution  can  take caching,  prefetching,  and  speculative  loading.  speculative  loading, as is firstly proposed and studied in this work, predicts and speculatively  loads  the  subresources  needed  to  open  a  webpage once its url is given. we show that while caching and prefetch-ing  are  highly  limited  for  mobile  browsing,  speculative  loading can  be  significantly  more  effective.  empirically,  we  show  that client-only solutions can improve the browser speed by about 1.4 second on average for websites visited by the 24 iphone users. we also  report  the  design,  realization,  and  evaluation  of  speculative loading  in  a  webkit-based  browser  called  tempo.  on  average, tempo can reduce browser delay by 1 second (~20%).
