we use modern features of web browsers to develop a secure login system from an untrusted terminal. the system, called session juggler, requires no server-side changes and no special software on the terminal beyond a modern web browser. this important property makes adoption much easier than with previous proposals. with session juggler users never enter their long term credential on the untrusted terminal. instead, users log in to a web site using a smartphone app and then transfer the entire session, including cookies and all other session state, to the untrusted terminal. we show that session juggler works on all the alexa top 100 sites except eight. of those eight,  ve failures were due to the site enforcing ip session binding. we also show that session juggler works  awlessly with facebook connect. beyond login, session juggler also provides a secure logout mechanism where the trusted phone is used to kill the session. to validate the session juggling concept we conducted a number of web site surveys that are of independent interest. first, we survey how web sites bind a session token to a speci c device and show that most use fairly basic techniques that are easily defeated. second, we survey how web sites handle logout and show that many popular sites surprisingly do not properly handle logout requests.
