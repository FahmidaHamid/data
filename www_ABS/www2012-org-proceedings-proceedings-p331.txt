in recent years, social networking sites have not only enabled people to connect with each other using social links but have also allowed them to share, communicate and interact over diverse geographical regions. social network provide a rich source of heterogeneous data which can be exploited to discover previously unknown relationships and interests among groups of people. in this paper, we address the problem of discovering topically meaningful communities from a social network. we assume that a persons  membership in a community is conditioned on its social relationship, the type of interaction and the information communicated with other members of that community. we propose generative models that can discover communities based on the discussed topics, interaction types and the social connections among people. in our models a person can belong to multiple communities and a community can participate in multiple topics. this allows us to discover both community interests and user interests based on the information and linked associations. we demonstrate the e ectiveness of our model on two real word data sets and show that it performs better than existing community discovery models.
