cellular networks employ a speci c radio resource management policy distinguishing them from wired and wi-fi networks. a lack of awareness of this important mechanism potentially leads to resource-inef cient mobile applications. we perform the  rst network-wide, large-scale investigation of a particular type of application traf c pattern called periodic transfers where a handset periodically exchanges some data with a remote server every t seconds. using packet traces containing 1.5 billion packets collected from a commercial cellular carrier, we found that periodic transfers are very prevalent in today s smartphone traf c. however, they are extremely resource-inef cient for both the network and end-user devices even though they predominantly generate very little traf c. this somewhat counter-intuitive behavior is a direct consequence of the adverse interaction between such periodic transfer patterns and the cellular network radio resource management policy. for example, for popular smartphone applications such as facebook, periodic transfers account for only 1.7% of the overall traf c volume but contribute to 30% of the total handset radio energy consumption. we found periodic transfers are generated for various reasons such as keep-alive, polling, and user behavior measurements. we further investigate the potential of various traf c shaping and resource control algorithms. depending on their traf c patterns, applications exhibit disparate responses to optimization strategies. jointly using several strategies with moderate aggressiveness can eliminate almost all energy impact of periodic transfers for popular applications such as facebook and pandora.
