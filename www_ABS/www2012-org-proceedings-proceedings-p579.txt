in contrast to traditional web search, where topical relevance is often the main selection criterion, news search is characterized by the increased importance of freshness. however, the estimation of relevance and freshness, and especially the relative importance of these two aspects, are highly speci c to the query and the time when the query was issued. in this work, we propose a uni ed framework for modeling the topical relevance and freshness, as well as their relative importance, based on click logs. we use click statistics and content analysis techniques to de ne a set of temporal features, which predict the right mix of freshness and relevance for a given query. experimental results on both historical click data and editorial judgments demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed approach.
