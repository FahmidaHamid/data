navigating information spaces is an essential part of our everyday lives, and in order to design ef cient and user-friendly information systems, it is important to understand how humans navigate and  nd the information they are looking for. we perform a large-scale study of human way nding, in which, given a network of links between the concepts of wikipedia, people play a game of  nding a short path from a given start to a given target concept by following hyperlinks. what distinguishes our setup from other studies of human web-browsing behavior is that in our case people navigate a graph of connections between concepts, and that the exact goal of the navigation is known ahead of time. we study more than 30,000 goal-directed human search paths and identify strategies people use when navigating information spaces. we  nd that human way nd-ing, while mostly very ef cient, differs from shortest paths in characteristic ways. most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase, while their search is guided by content features thereafter. we also observe a trade-off between simplicity and ef- ciency conceptually simple solutions are more common but tend to be less ef cient than more complex ones. finally, we consider the task of predicting the target a user is trying to reach. we design a model and an ef cient learning algorithm. such predictive models of human way nding can be applied in intelligent browsing interfaces.
