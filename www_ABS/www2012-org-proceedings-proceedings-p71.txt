in this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of the cy-ber criminal ecosystem on twitter. essentially, through analyzing inner social relationships in the criminal account community, we  nd that criminal accounts tend to be socially connected, forming a small-world network. we also  nd that criminal hubs, sitting in the center of the social graph, are more inclined to follow criminal accounts. through analyzing outer social relationships between criminal accounts and their social friends outside the criminal account community, we reveal three categories of accounts that have close friendships with criminal accounts. through these analyses, we provide a novel and e ective criminal account inference algorithm by exploiting criminal accounts  social relationships and semantic coordinations.
