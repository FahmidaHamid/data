the web application domain is one of the fastest growing and most widespread application domains today. by utilizing fast, modern web browsers and advanced scripting techniques, web developers are developing highly interactive applications that can, in terms of user-experience and responsiveness, compete with standard desktop applications. a web application is composed of two equally important parts the server-side and the client-side. the client-side acts as a user-interface to the application, and can be viewed as a collection of behaviors. similar behaviors are often used in a large number of applications, and facilitating their reuse o ers considerable bene ts. however, due to client-side speci cs, such as multi-language implementation and extreme dynamicity, identifying and extracting code responsible for a certain behavior is di cult. in this paper we present a semiautomatic method for extracting client-side web application code implementing a certain behavior. we show how by analyzing the execution of a usage scenario, code responsible for a certain behavior can be identi ed, how dependencies between di erent parts of the application can be tracked, and how in the end only the code responsible for a certain behavior can be extracted. our evaluation shows that the method is capable of extracting standalone behaviors, while achieving considerable savings in terms of code size and application performance.
