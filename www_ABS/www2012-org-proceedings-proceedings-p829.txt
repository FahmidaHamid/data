forms are our gates to the web. they enable us to access the deep content of web sites. automatic form understanding unlocks this content for applications ranging from crawlers to meta-search engines and is essential for improving usability and accessibility of the web. form understanding has received surprisingly little attention other than as component in speci c applications such as crawlers. no comprehensive approach to form understanding exists and previous works disagree even in the de nition of the problem. in this paper, we present opal, the  rst comprehensive approach to form understanding. we identify form labeling and form interpretation as the two main tasks involved in form understanding. on both problems opal pushes the state of the art for form labeling, it combines signals from the text, structure, and visual rendering of a web page, yielding robust characterisations of common design patterns. in extensive experiments on the icq and tel-8 benchmarks and a set of 200 modern web forms opal outperforms previous approaches by a signi cant margin. for form interpretation, we introduce a template language to describe frequent form patterns. these two parts of opal combined yield form understanding with near perfect accuracy (> 98%).
