this paper presents a new unsupervised approach to generating ultra-concise summaries of opinions. we formulate the problem of generating such a micropinion summary as an optimization problem, where we seek a set of concise and non-redundant phrases that are readable and represent key opinions in text. we measure representativeness based on a modi ed mutual information function and model readability with an n-gram language model. we propose some heuristic algorithms to e ciently solve this optimization problem. evaluation results show that our unsupervised approach outperforms other state of the art summarization methods and the generated summaries are informative and readable.
