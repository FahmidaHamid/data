planners and social psychologists have suggested that the recognizability of the urban environment is linked to people s socioeconomic well-being. we build a web game that puts the recognizability of london s streets to the test. it follows as closely as possible one experiment done by stanley milgram in 1972. the game picks up random locations from google street view and tests users to see if they can judge the location in terms of closest subway station, borough, or region. each participant dedicates only few minutes to the task (as opposed to 90 minutes in milgram s). we collect data from 2,255 participants (one order of magnitude a larger sample) and build a recognizability map of lon-don based on their responses. we  nd that some boroughs have little cognitive representation; that recognizability of an area is explained partly by its exposure to flickr and foursquare users and mostly by its exposure to subway passengers; and that areas with low recognizability do not fare any worse on the economic indicators of income, education, and employment, but they do signi cantly su er from social problems of housing deprivation, poor living conditions, and crime. these results could not have been produced without analyzing life o - and online that is, without considering the interactions between urban places in the physical world and their virtual presence on platforms such as flickr and foursquare. this line of work is at the crossroad of two emerging themes in computing research - a crossroad where  web science  meets the  smart city  agenda.
