cascading style sheets (css) took a valuable step towards separating web content from presentation. but html pages still contain large amounts of  design sca olding  needed to hierarchically layer content for proper presentation. this paper presents cascading tree sheets (cts), a css-like language for separating this presentational html from real content. with cts, authors use standard css selectors to describe how to graft presentational sca olding onto their pure-content html. this improved separation of content from presentation enables even naive authors to incorporate rich layouts (including interactive javascript) into their own pages simply by linking to a tree sheet and adding some class names to their html.
