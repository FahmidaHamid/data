the  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  and  the web-based  products  it  provides  is  responsible  for  significant emissions of greenhouse gases. in order to enable the reduction of emissions  during  the  design  of  such  products,  it  is  necessary  to estimate  as  accurately  as  possible  their  carbon  impact  over  the entire  product  system.  in  this  work  we  describe  a  new  method which combines models of energy consumption during the use of digital  media  with  models  of  the  behavior  of  the  audience.  we apply this method to conduct an assessment of the annual carbon emissions  for  the  product  suite  of  a  major  international  news organization.  we  then  demonstrate  its  use  for  green  design  by evaluating  the  impacts  of  five  different  interventions  on  the product  suite.  we  find  that  carbon  footprint  of  the  online newspaper  amounts  to  approximately  7700  tco2e  per  year,  of which 75% are caused by the user devices. among the evaluated scenarios a significant uptake of ereaders in favor of pcs has the greatest  reduction  potential.  our  results  also  show  that  even  a significant  reduction  of  data  volume  on  a  web  page  would  only result in small overall energy savings.
