recommender systems associated with social networks often use social explanations (e.g.  x, y and 2 friends like this ) to support the recommendations. we present a study of the e ects of these social explanations in a music recommendation context. we start with an experiment with 237 users, in which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and analyze their e ect on users  decisions. we distinguish between two key decisions the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist, and the actual rating of the artist based on listening to several songs. we  nd that while the explanations do have some in uence on the likelihood, there is little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the same artist. based on these insights, we present a generative probabilistic model that explains the interplay between explanations and background information on music preferences, and how that leads to a  nal likelihood rating for an artist. acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in the recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users.
