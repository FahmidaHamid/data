the data web contains a wealth of knowledge on a large number of domains. question answering over interlinked data sources is challenging due to two inherent characteristics. first, di erent datasets employ heterogeneous schemas and each one may only contain a part of the answer for a certain question. second, constructing a federated formal query across di erent datasets requires exploiting links between the di erent datasets on both the schema and instance levels. we present a question answering system, which transforms user supplied queries (i.e. natural language sentences or keywords) into conjunctive sparql queries over a set of interlinked data sources. the contribution of this paper is twofold firstly, we introduce a novel approach for determining the most suitable resources for a user-supplied query from di erent datasets (disambiguation). we employ a hidden markov model, whose parameters were bootstrapped with di erent distribution functions. secondly, we present a novel method for constructing a federated formal queries using the disambiguated resources and leveraging the linking structure of the underlying datasets. this approach essentially relies on a combination of domain and range inference as well as a link traversal method for constructing a connected graph which ultimately renders a corresponding sparql query. the results of our evaluation with three life-science datasets and 25 benchmark queries demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach.
