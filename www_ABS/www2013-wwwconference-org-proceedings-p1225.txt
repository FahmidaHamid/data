an increasing amount of applications build their functionality on the utilisation and manipulation of web resources. consequently rest gains popularity with a resource-centric interaction architecture that draws its  exibility from links between resources. linked data o ers a uniform data model for rest with self-descriptive resources that can be leveraged to avoid a manual ad-hoc development of web-based applications. for declaratively specifying interactions between web resources we introduce data-fu, a lightweight declarative rule language with state transition systems as formal grounding. data-fu enables the development of data-driven applications that facilitate the restful manipulation of read/write linked data resources. furthermore, we describe an interpreter for data-fu as a general purpose engine that allows to perform described interactions with web resources by orders of magnitude faster than a comparable linked data processor.
