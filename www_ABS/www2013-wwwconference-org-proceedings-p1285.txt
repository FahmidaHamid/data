we propose a novel algorithm for uncovering the colloquial boundaries of locally characterizing regions present in collections of labeled geospatial data. we address the problem by  rst modeling the data using scale-space theory, allowing us to represent it simultaneously across di erent scales as a family of increasingly smoothed density distributions. we then derive region boundaries by applying localized label weighting and image processing techniques to the scale-space representation of each label. important insights into the data can be acquired by visualizing the shape and size of the resulting boundaries for each label at multiple scales. we demonstrate our technique operating at scale by discovering the boundaries of the most geospatially salient tags associated with a large collection of georeferenced photos from flickr and compare our characterizing regions that emerge from the data with those produced by a recent technique from the research literature.
