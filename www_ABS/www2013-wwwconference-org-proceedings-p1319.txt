how often do individuals perform a given communication activity in the web, such as posting comments on blogs or news? could we have a generative model to create communication events with realistic inter-event time distributions (ieds)? which properties should we strive to match? current literature has seemingly contradictory results for ied some studies claim good  ts with power laws; others with non-homogeneous poisson processes. given these two approaches, we ask which is the correct one? can we reconcile them all? we show here that, surprisingly, both approaches are correct, being corner cases of the proposed self-feeding process (sfp). we show that the sfp (a) exhibits a unifying power, which generates power law tails (including the so-called  top-concavity  that real data exhibits), as well as short-term poisson behavior; (b) avoids the  i.i.d. fallacy , which none of the prevailing models have studied before; and (c) is extremely parsimonious, requiring usually only one, and in general, at most two parameters. experiments conducted on eight large, diverse real datasets (e.g., youtube and blog comments, emails, smss, etc) reveal that the sfp mimics their properties very well.
