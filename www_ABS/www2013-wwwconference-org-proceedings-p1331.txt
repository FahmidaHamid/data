nowadays, micro-blogging systems like twitter have become one of the most important ways for information sharing. in twitter, a user posts a message (tweet) and the others can forward the message (retweet). mention is a new feature in micro-blogging systems. by mentioning users in a tweet, they will receive noti cations and their possible retweets may help to initiate large cascade di usion of the tweet. to enhance a tweet s di usion by  nding the right persons to mention, we propose in this paper a novel recommendation scheme named as whom-to-mention. speci cally, we present an in-depth study of mention mechanism and propose a recommendation scheme to solve the essential question of whom to mention in a tweet. in this paper, whom-to-mention is formulated as a ranking problem and we try to address several new challenges which are not well studied in the traditional information retrieval tasks. by adopting features including user interest match, content-dependent user relationship and user in uence, a machine learned ranking function is trained based on newly de ned information diffusion based relevance. the extensive evaluation using data gathered from real users demonstrates the advantage of our proposed algorithm compared with the traditional recommendation methods.
