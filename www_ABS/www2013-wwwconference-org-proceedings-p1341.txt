efforts such as wikipedia have shown the ability of user communities to collect, organize and curate information on the internet. recently, a number of question and answer (q&a) sites have successfully built large growing knowledge repositories, each driven by a wide range of questions and answers from its users community. while sites like yahoo answers have stalled and begun to shrink, one site still going strong is quora, a rapidly growing service that augments a regular q&a system with social links between users. despite its success, however, little is known about what drives quora s growth, and how it continues to connect visitors and experts to the right questions as it grows. in this paper, we present results of a detailed analysis of quora using measurements. we shed light on the impact of three different connection networks (or graphs) inside quora, a graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions. our results show that heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are signi cant contributors to the quality of quora s knowledge base. one drives the attention and activity of users, and the other directs them to a small set of popular and interesting questions.
