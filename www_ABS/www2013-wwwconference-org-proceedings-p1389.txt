g+ ripples is a visualization of information flow that shows users how  public  posts  are  shared  on  google+.  unlike  other  social network visualizations, ripples exists as a  native  visualization it is directly accessible from public posts on google+. this unique position  leads  to  both  new  constraints  and  new  possibilities  for design. we describe the visualization technique, which is a new mix  of  node-and-link  and  circular  treemap  metaphors.  we  then describe user reactions as well as some of the patterns of sharing that are made evident by the ripples visualization.
