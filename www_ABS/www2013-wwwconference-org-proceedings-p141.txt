motivated by applications to word-of-mouth advertising, we consider a game-theoretic scenario in which competing advertisers want to target initial adopters in a social network. each advertiser wishes to maximize the resulting cascade of in uence, modeled by a general network di usion process. however, competition between products may adversely impact the rate of adoption for any given  rm. the resulting framework gives rise to complex preferences that depend on the speci cs of the stochastic di usion model and the network topology. we study this model from the perspective of a central mechanism, such as a social networking platform, that can optimize seed placement as a service for the advertisers. we ask given the reported demands of the competing  rms, how should a mechanism choose seeds to maximize overall e ciency? beyond the algorithmic problem, competition raises issues of strategic behaviour rational agents should not be incentivized to underreport their budget demands. we show that when there are two players, the social welfare can be 2-approximated by a polynomial-time strate-gyproof mechanism. our mechanism is de ned recursively, randomizing the order in which advertisers are allocated seeds according to a particular greedy method. for three or more players, we demonstrate that under additional assumptions (satis ed by many existing models of in uence spread) e e 1 approximation mech-there exists a simpler strategyproof anism; notably, this second mechanism is not necessarily strategyproof when there are only two players.
