recently  many  popular  websites  such  as  twitter  and  flickr  expose  their  data  through  web  service  apis,  enabling  third-party organizations to develop client applications that provide functionalities beyond what the original websites offer. these client applications should follow certain constraints in order to correctly interact  with  the  web  services.  one  common  type  of  such  constraints  is  dependency	 constraints	 on	 parameters.  given  a  web service operation o and its parameters pi, pj, , these constraints describe the requirement on one parameter pi that is dependent on the conditions of some other parameter(s) pj. for example, when requesting  the  twitter  operation   get	 statuses/user_timeline ,  a user_id parameter must be provided if a screen_name parameter is not provided. violations of such constraints can cause fatal errors or incorrect results in the client applications. however, these constraints are often not formally specified and thus not available for automatic verification of client applications. to address this issue, we propose a novel approach, called indicator, to automatically infer dependency	constraints	on	parameters	for web services, via a hybrid analysis of heterogeneous web service artifacts, including the  service  documentation,  the  service  sdks,  and  the  web  services themselves. to evaluate our approach, we applied indica  tor	 to  infer  dependency  constraints  for  four  popular  web  services. the results showed that indicator effectively infers constraints with an average precision of 94.4% and recall of 95.5%.
