traditionally, collaborative filtering assumes that similar users have similar responses to similar items. however, human activities exhibit heterogenous features across multiple domains such that users own similar tastes in one domain may behave quite di erently in other domains. moreover, highly sparse data presents crucial challenge in preference prediction. intuitively, if users  interested domains are captured  rst, the recommender system is more likely to provide the enjoyed items while  lter out those uninterested ones. therefore, it is necessary to learn preference pro les from the correlated domains instead of the entire user-item matrix. in this paper, we propose a uni ed framework, toprec, which detects topical communities to construct interpretable domains for domain-speci c collaborative  ltering. in order to mine communities as well as the corresponding topics, a semi-supervised probabilistic topic model is utilized by integrating user guidance with social network. experimental results on real-world data from epinions and ciao demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed framework.
