an essential aspect for building e ective crowdsourcing computations is the ability of  controlling the crowd , i.e. of dynamically adapting the behaviour of the crowdsourcing systems as response to the quantity and quality of completed tasks or to the availability and reliability of performers. most crowdsourcing systems only provide limited and prede ned controls; in contrast, we present an approach to crowdsourcing which provides  ne-level, powerful and  ex-ible controls. we model each crowdsourcing application as composition of elementary task types and we progressively transform these high level speci cations into the features of a reactive execution environment that supports task planning, assignment and completion as well as performer monitoring and exclusion. controls are speci ed as active rules on top of data structures which are derived from the model of the application; rules can be added, dropped or modi ed, thus guaranteeing maximal  exibility with limited e ort. we also report on our prototype platform that implements the proposed framework and we show the results of our ex-perimentations with di erent rule sets, demonstrating how simple changes to the rules can substantially a ect time, e ort and quality involved in crowdsourcing activities.
