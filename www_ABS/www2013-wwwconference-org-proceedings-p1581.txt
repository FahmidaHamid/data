discretization  is  a  standard  technique  used  in  click-based graphical  passwords  for that approximately  correct  passwords  are  accepted  by  the  system.  in this  paper,  we  show  for  the  first  time  that  two  representative discretization  schemes  leak  a  significant  amount  of  password information,  undermining the  security  of  such  graphical passwords.  we  exploit  such  information  leakage  for  successful dictionary  attacks  on  persuasive  cued  click  points  (pccp), which  is  to  date  the  most  secure  click-based  graphical  password scheme and was considered to be resistant to such attacks. in our experiments,  our  purely  automated  attack  successfully  guessed 69.2% of the passwords when centered discretization was used to implement  pccp,  and  39.4%  of  the  passwords  when  robust discretization  was  used.  each  attack  dictionary  we  used  was  of approximately 2  entries, whereas the full password space was of 2  entries.  for  centered  discretization,  our  attack  still successfully  guessed  50%  of  the  passwords  when  the  dictionary size  was  reduced  to  approximately 2  entries.  our  attack  is  also applicable  to  common  implementations  of  other  click-based graphical  password  systems  such  as  passpoints  and  cued  click points     both  have  been  extensively  studied  in  the  research communities.
