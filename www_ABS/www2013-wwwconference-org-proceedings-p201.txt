there  is  a  rising  concern  among  parents  who  have  experienced unreliable  content  maturity  ratings  for  mobile  applications (apps) that result in inappropriate risk exposure for their children and adolescents. in reality, there is no consistent maturity rating policy for  mobile applications. the maturity ratings of  android apps are provided purely by developers  self-disclosure and are rarely verified. while apple s ios app ratings are considered to be  more  accurate,  they  can  also  be  inconsistent  with  apple s published policies. to address these issues, this research aims to systematically  uncover  the  extent  and  severity  of  unreliable maturity  ratings  for  mobile  apps.  specifically,  we  develop mechanisms  to  verify  the  maturity  ratings  of  mobile  apps  and investigate  possible  reasons  behind  the  incorrect  ratings.  we believe  that  our  findings  have  important  implications  for platform  providers  (e.g.,  google  or  apple)  as  well  as  for regulatory bodies and application developers.
