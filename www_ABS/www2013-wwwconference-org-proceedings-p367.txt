crowdsourcing allows to build hybrid online platforms that combine scalable information systems with the power of human intelligence to complete tasks that are di cult to tackle for current algorithms. examples include hybrid database systems that use the crowd to  ll missing values or to sort items according to subjective dimensions such as picture attractiveness. current approaches to crowdsourcing adopt a pull methodology where tasks are published on specialized web platforms where workers can pick their preferred tasks on a  rst-come- rst-served basis. while this approach has many advantages, such as simplicity and short completion times, it does not guarantee that the task is performed by the most suitable worker. in this paper, we propose and extensively evaluate a di erent crowdsourcing approach based on a push methodology. our proposed system carefully selects which workers should perform a given task based on worker pro les extracted from social networks. workers and tasks are automatically matched using an underlying categorization structure that exploits entities extracted from the task descriptions on one hand, and categories liked by the user on social platforms on the other hand. we experimentally evaluate our approach on tasks of varying complexity and show that our push methodology consistently yield better results than usual pull strategies.
