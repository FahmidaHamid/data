recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (kbs), which capture knowledge in a ma-chine-readable format. inductive logic programming (ilp) can be used to mine logical rules from the kb. these rules can help deduce and add missing knowledge to the kb. while ilp is a mature  eld, mining logical rules from kbs is di erent in two aspects first, current rule mining systems are easily overwhelmed by the amount of data (state-of-the art systems cannot even run on today s kbs). second, ilp usually requires counterexamples. kbs, however, implement the open world assumption (owa), meaning that absent data cannot be used as counterexamples. in this paper, we develop a rule mining model that is explicitly tailored to support the owa scenario. it is inspired by association rule mining and introduces a novel measure for con dence. our extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and coverage. furthermore, our system, amie, mines rules orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches.
