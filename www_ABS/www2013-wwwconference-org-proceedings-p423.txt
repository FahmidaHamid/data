uncovering the  nature  of the connections between a set of entities e.g. passengers on a  ight and organizations on a watchlist can be viewed as a multi-source multi-destination (msmd) path query problem on labeled graph data models such as rdf. using existing graph-navigational path  nd-ing techniques to solve msmd problems will require queries to be decomposed into multiple single-source or destination path subqueries, each of which is solved independently. navigational techniques on disk-resident graphs typically generate very poor i/o access patterns for large, disk-resident graphs and for msmd path queries, such poor access patterns may be repeated if common graph exploration steps exist across subqueries. in this paper, we propose an optimization technique for general msmd path queries that generalizes an e cient algebraic approach for solving a variety of single-source path problems. the generalization enables holistic evaluation of msmd path queries without the need for query decomposition. we present a conceptual framework for sharing computation in the algebraic framework that is based on  su x equivalence . su x equivalence amongst subqueries captures the fact that multiple subqueries with di erent pre- xes can share a su x and as such share the computation of shared su xes, which allows pre x path computations to share common su x path computations. this approach offers orders of magnitude better performance than current existing techniques as demonstrated by a comprehensive experimental evaluation over real and synthetic datasets.
