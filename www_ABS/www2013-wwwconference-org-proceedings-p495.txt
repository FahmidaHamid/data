increasingly, web recommender systems face scenarios where they need to serve suggestions to groups of users; for example, when families share e-commerce or movie rental web accounts. research to date in this domain has proposed two approaches computing recommendations for the group by merging any members  ratings into a single pro le, or computing ranked recommendations for each individual that are then merged via a range of heuristics. in doing so, none of the past approaches reason on the preferences that arise in individuals when they are members of a group. in this work, we present a probabilistic framework, based on the notion of information matching, for group recommendation. this model de nes group relevance as a combination of the item s relevance to each user as an individual and as a member of the group; it can then seamlessly incorporate any group recommendation strategy in order to rank items for a set of individuals. we evaluate the model s e cacy at generating recommendations for both single individuals and groups using the movielens and moviepilot data sets. in both cases, we compare our results with baselines and state-of-the-art collaborative  ltering algorithms, and show that the model outperforms all others over a variety of ranking metrics.
