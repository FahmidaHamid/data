web application frameworks are a proven means to accelerate the development of interactive web applications. however, implementing collaborative real-time applications like google docs requires speci c concurrency control services (i.e. document synchronization and con ict resolution) that are not included in prevalent general-purpose frameworks like jquery or knockout. hence, developers have to get familiar with speci c collaboration frameworks (e.g. sharejs) which substantially increases the development e ort. to ease the development of collaborative web applications, we propose a set of source code annotations representing a lightweight mechanism to introduce concurrency control services into mature web frameworks. those annotations are interpreted at runtime by a dedicated collaboration engine to sync documents and resolve con icts. we enhanced the general-purpose framework knockout with a collaboration engine and conducted a developer study comparing our approach to a traditional concurrency control library. the evaluation results show that the e ort to incorporate collaboration capabilities into a web application can be reduced by up to 40 percent using the annotation-based solution.
