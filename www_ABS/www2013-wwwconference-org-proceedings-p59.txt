when browsers report tls errors, they cannot distinguish between attacks and harmless server miscon gurations; hence they leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. however, actual attacks remain rare. as a result, users quickly become used to  false positives  that deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay su -cient scrutiny when a real attack comes along. consequently, browser vendors should aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. to guide that process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common tls warnings. using a set of passive network monitors located at di erent sites, we identify the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a nine-month period. we identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. we study the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets used in previous tls measurement studies. a key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal browser code instead of generic tls libraries for analysis, providing more accurate and representative results.
