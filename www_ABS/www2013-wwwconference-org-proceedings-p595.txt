collaborative filtering (cf) is a major technique in recommender systems to help users find their potentially desired items. since the data sparsity problem is quite commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, cross-domain collaborative filtering (cdcf) hence is becoming an emerging research topic in recent years. however, due to  the  lack  of  sufficient  dense  explicit  feedbacks  and  even  no feedback  available  in  users   uninvolved  domains,  current  cdcf approaches  may  not  perform  satisfactorily  in  user  preference prediction. in this paper, we propose a generalized cross domain triadic factorization (cdtf) model over the triadic relation user-item-domain,  which  can  better  capture  the  interactions  between domain-specific  user  factors  and  item  factors.  in  particular,  we devise two cdtf algorithms to leverage user explicit and implicit feedbacks  respectively,  along  with  a  genetic  algorithm  based weight  parameters  tuning  algorithm  to  trade  off influence  among domains  optimally.  finally,  we  conduct  experiments  to  evaluate our models and compare with other state-of-the-art models by using two  real  world  datasets.  the  results  show  the  superiority  of  our models against other comparative models.
