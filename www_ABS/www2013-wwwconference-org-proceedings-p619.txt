online social networks (osns) have become a popular new vector for distributing malware and spam, which we refer to as socware. unlike email spam, which is sent by spammers directly to intended victims, socware cascades through osns as compromised users spread it to their friends. in this paper, we analyze data from the walls of roughly 3 million face-book users over  ve months, with the goal of developing a better understanding of socware cascades. we study socware cascades to understand (a) their spatio-temporal properties, (b) the underlying motivations and mechanisms, and (c) the social engineering tricks used to con users. first, we identify an evolving trend in which cascades appear to be throttling their rate of growth to evade detection, and thus, lasting longer. second, our forensic investigation into the infrastructure that supports these cascades shows that, surprisingly, facebook seems to be inadvertently enabling most cascades; 44% of cascades are disseminated via facebook applications. at the same time, we observe large groups of synergistic facebook apps (more than 144 groups of size 5 or more) that collaborate to support multiple cascades. lastly, we  nd that hackers rely on two social engineering tricks in equal measure luring users with free products and appealing to users  social curiosity to enable socware cascades. our  ndings present several promising avenues towards reducing socware on facebook, but also highlight associated challenges.
