peer-to-peer networks are the most popular mechanism for the criminal acquisition and distribution of child pornography (cp). in this paper, we examine observations of peers sharing known cp on the emule and gnutella networks, which were collected by law enforcement using forensic tools that we developed. we characterize a year s worth of network activity and evaluate di erent strategies for prioritizing investigators  limited resources. the highest impact research in criminal forensics works within, and is evaluated under, the constraints and goals of investigations. we follow that principle, rather than presenting a set of isolated, exploratory characterizations of users. first, we focus on strategies for reducing the number of cp  les available on the network by removing a minimal number of peers. we present a metric for peer removal that is more e ective than simply selecting peers with the largest libraries or the most days online. second, we characterize six aggressive peer subgroups, including peers using tor, peers that bridge multiple p2p networks, and the top 10% of peers contributing to  le availability. we  nd that these subgroups are more active in their tra cking, having more known cp and more uptime, than the average peer. finally, while in theory tor presents a challenge to investigators, we observe that in practice o enders use tor inconsistently. over 90% of regular tor users send tra c from a non-tor ip at least once after  rst using tor.
