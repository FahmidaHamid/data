recent trends in public-key infrastructure research explore the trade-off between decreased trust in certi cate authorities (cas), resilience against attacks, communication overhead (bandwidth and latency) for setting up an ssl/tls connection, and availability with respect to veri ability of public key information. in this paper, we propose aki as a new public-key validation infrastructure, to reduce the level of trust in cas. aki integrates an architecture for key revocation of all entities (e.g., cas, domains) with an architecture for accountability of all infrastructure parties through checks-and-balances. aki ef ciently handles common certi cation operations, and gracefully handles catastrophic events such as domain key loss or compromise. we propose aki to make progress towards a public-key validation infrastructure with key revocation that reduces trust in any single entity.
