data centers run many services that impact millions of users daily. in reality, the latency of each service varies from one request to another. existing tools allow to monitor services for performance glitches or service disruptions, but typically they do not help understanding the variations in latency. we propose a general framework for understanding performance of arbitrary black box services. we consider a stream of requests to a given service with their monitored attributes, as well as latencies of serving each request. we propose what we call the multidimensional f measure, that helps for a given interval to identify the subset of monitored attributes that explains it. we design algorithms that use this measure not only for a  xed latency interval, but also to explain the entire range of latencies of the service by segmenting it into smaller intervals. we perform a detailed experimental study with synthetic data, as well as real data from a large search engine. our experiments show that our methods automatically identify signi cant latency intervals together with request attributes that explain them, and are robust.
