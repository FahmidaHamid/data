result diversi cation has gained a lot of attention as a way to answer ambiguous queries and to tackle the redundancy problem in the results. in the last decade, diversi cation has been applied on or integrated into the process of pagerank-or eigenvector-based methods that run on various graphs, including social networks, collaboration networks in academia, web and product co-purchasing graphs. for these applications, the diversi cation problem is usually addressed as a bicriteria objective optimization problem of relevance and diversity. however, such an approach is questionable since a query-oblivious diversi cation algorithm that recommends most of its results without even considering the query may perform the best on these commonly used measures. in this paper, we show the de ciencies of popular evaluation techniques of diversi cation methods, and investigate multiple relevance and diversity measures to understand whether they have any correlations. next, we propose a novel measure called expanded relevance which combines both relevance and diversity into a single function in order to measure the coverage of the relevant part of the graph. we also present a new greedy diversi cation algorithm called best-coverage, which optimizes the expanded relevance of the result set with (1  1/e)-approximation. with a rigorous experimentation on graphs from various applications, we show that the proposed method is e cient and e ective for many use cases.
