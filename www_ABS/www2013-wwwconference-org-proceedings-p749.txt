in  recent  years  the  web  has  evolved  substantially,  transforming from  a  place  where  we  primarily  find  information  to  a  place where we also leave, share and keep it. this presents a fresh set of challenges  for  the  management  of  personal  information,  which include how to underpin greater awareness and more control over digital belongings and other personally meaningful content that is hosted  online.  in  the  study  reported  here,  we  follow  up  on  research that suggests a sense of ownership and control can be reinforced by federating online content as a virtual, single store; we do this by conducting interviews with 14 individuals about their web-based content. participants were asked to give the researchers a tour of online content that is personally meaningful to them; to perform a search for themselves in order to uncover additional content; and to respond to a series of design envisionments. we examine whether there is any value in an integrated personal archive  that  would  automatically  update  and  serve  firstly,  as  a source of information regarding the content within it (e.g. where it is stored, who has the rights to it), and secondly, as a resource for crafting personal artefacts such as scrapbooks, cvs and gifts for others. our analysis leads us to reject the concept of a single archive. instead, we present a framework of five different types of online  content,  each  of  which  has  separate  implications  for  personal information management.
