we present a large-scale measurement of clusters of hosts sharing the same local dns servers. we analyze properties of these  ldns clusters  from the perspective of content delivery networks, which commonly use dns for load distribution. we found that not only ldns clusters di er widely in terms of their size and geographical compactness but that the largest clusters are actually extremely compact. this suggests potential bene ts of a load distribution strategy with nuanced treatment of di erent ldns clusters based on the combination of their size and compactness. we further observed interesting variations in ldns setups including a wide use of  ldns pools  (which as we explain in the paper are di erent from setups where end-hosts simply utilize multiple resolvers).
