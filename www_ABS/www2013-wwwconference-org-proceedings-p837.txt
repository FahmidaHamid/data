the theory of structural holes [4] suggests that individuals would bene t from  lling the  holes  (called as structural hole spanners) between people or groups that are otherwise disconnected. a few empirical studies have veri ed that structural hole spanners play a key role in the information diffusion. however, there is still lack of a principled methodology to detect structural hole spanners from a given social network. in this work, we precisely de ne the problem of mining top-k structural hole spanners in large-scale social networks and provide an objective (quality) function to formalize the problem. two in-stantiation models have been developed to implement the objective function. for the  rst model, we present an exact algorithm to solve it and prove its convergence. as for the second model, the optimization is proved to be np-hard, and we design an ef cient algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. we test the proposed models on three different networks coauthor, twitter, and inventor. our study provides evidence for the theory of structural holes, e.g., 1% of twitter users who span structural holes control 25% of the information diffusion on twitter. we compare the proposed models with several alternative methods and the results show that our models clearly outperform the comparison methods. our experiments also demonstrate that the detected structural hole spanners can help other social network applications, such as community kernel detection and link prediction. to the best of our knowledge, this is the  rst attempt to address the problem of mining structural hole spanners in large social networks.
