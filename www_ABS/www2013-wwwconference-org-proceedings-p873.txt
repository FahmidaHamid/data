online service platforms (osps), such as search engines, news-websites, ad-providers, etc., serve highly personalized content to the user, based on the pro le extracted from her history with the osp. although personalization (generally) leads to a better user experience, it also raises privacy concerns for the user she does not know what is present in her pro le and more importantly, what is being used to personalize her content. in this paper, we capture osp s per-sonalization for an user in a new data structure called the personalization vector ( ), which is a weighted vector over a set of topics, and present e cient algorithms to learn it. our approach treats osps as black-boxes, and extracts   by mining only their output, speci cally, the personalized (for an user) and vanilla (without any user information) contents served, and the di erences in these content. we believe that such treatment of osps is a unique aspect of our work, not just enabling access to (so far hidden) pro les in osps, but also providing a novel and practical approach for retrieving information from osps by mining di erences in their outputs. we formulate a new model called latent topic person-alization (ltp) that captures the personalization vector in a learning framework and present e cient inference algorithms for determining it. we perform extensive experiments targeting search engine personalization, using data from both real google users and synthetic setup. our results indicate that ltp achieves high accuracy (r-pre = 84%) in discovering personalized topics. for google data, our qualitative results demonstrate that the topics determined by ltp for a user correspond well to his ad-categories determined by google.
