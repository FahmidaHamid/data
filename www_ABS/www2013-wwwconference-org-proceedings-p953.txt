as search pages are becoming increasingly complex, with images and nonlinear page layouts, understanding how users examine the page is important. we present a lab study on the e ect of a rich informational panel to the right of the search result column, on eye and mouse behavior. using eye and mouse data, we show that the  ow of user attention on nonlinear page layouts is di erent from the widely believed top-down linear examination order of search results. we further demonstrate that the mouse, like the eye, is sensitive to two key attributes of page elements   their position (layout), and their relevance to the user s task. we identify mouse measures that are strongly correlated with eye movements, and develop models to predict user attention (eye gaze) from mouse activity. these  ndings show that mouse tracking can be used to infer user attention and information  ow patterns on search pages. potential applications include ranking, search page optimization, and ui evaluation.
