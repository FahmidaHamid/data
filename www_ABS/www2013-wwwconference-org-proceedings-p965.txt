 catch-up , or on-demand access of previously broadcast tv content over the public internet, constitutes a signi cant fraction of peak time network tra c. this paper analyses consumption patterns of nearly 6 million users of a nationwide deployment of a catch-up tv service, to understand the network support required. we  nd that catch-up has certain natural scaling properties compared to traditional tv the on-demand nature spreads load over time, and users have much higher completion rates for content streams than previously reported. users exhibit strong preferences for se-rialised content, and for speci c genres. exploiting this, we design a speculative content o oad-ing and recording engine (score) that predictively records a personalised set of shows on user-local storage, and thereby o oads tra c that might result from subsequent catch-up access. evaluations show that even with a modest storage of 32gb, an oracle with complete knowledge of user consumption can save up to 74% of the energy, and 97% of the peak bandwidth compared to the current ip streaming-based architecture. in the best case, optimising for energy consumption, score can recover more than 60% of the tra c and energy savings achieved by the oracle. optimising purely for tra c rather than energy can reduce bandwith by an additional 5%.
