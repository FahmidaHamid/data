many web information services utilize techniques of information extraction (ie) to collect important facts from the web. to create more advanced services, one possible method is to discover thematic information from the collected facts through text classi-(cid2)cation. however, most conventional text classi(cid2)cation techniques rely on manual-labelled corpora and are thus ill-suited to cooperate with web information services with open domains. in this work, we present a system named liveclassi(cid2)er that can automatically train classi(cid2)ers through web corpora based on user-de(cid2)ned topic hierarchies. due to its (cid3)exibility and convenience, liveclassi(cid2)er can be easily adapted for various purposes. new web information services can be created to fully exploit it; human users can use it to create classi(cid2)ers for their personal applications. the effectiveness of classi(cid2)ers created by liveclassi(cid2)er is well supported by empirical evidence.
