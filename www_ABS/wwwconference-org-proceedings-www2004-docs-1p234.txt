there  exist  many  portal  servers  that  support  the  construction  of  my   portals,  that  is,  portals  that  allow  the  user  to  have  one  or more  personal  pages  composed  of  a  number  of  personalizable services. the main drawback of current portal servers is their lack of generality and adaptability. this paper presents the design of mypersonalizer,  a  j2ee-based  framework  for  engineering  my portals.  the  framework  is  structured  according  to  the  model-view-controller  and  layers  architectural  patterns,  providing generic, adaptable model and controller layers that implement the typical  use  cases  of  a  my  portal.  mypersonalizer  allows  for  a good  separation  of  roles  in  the  development  team  graphical designers  (without  programming  skills)  develop  the  portal  view by writing jsp pages, while software engineers implement service plugins and specify framework configuration.
