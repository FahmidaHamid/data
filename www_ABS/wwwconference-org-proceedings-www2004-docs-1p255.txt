two  important  architectural  choices  underlie  the  success  of  the web  numerous,  independently  operated  servers  speak  a  common protocol, and  a  single  type  of  client the  web  browser provides point-and-click  access  to  the  content  and  services  on  these  decentralized servers. however, because html marries content and presentation into a single representation, end users are often stuck with inappropriate choices made by the web site designer of how to work with  and  view  the  content.  rdf  metadata  on  the  semantic  web does  not  have  this  limitation  users  can  gain  direct  access  to  the underlying  information  and  control  how  it  is  presented  for  themselves.  this  principle  forms  the  basis  for  our  semantic  web browser an  end  user  application  that  automatically  locates  meta-data and assembles point-and-click interfaces from a combination of relevant  information,  ontological  specifications,  and  presentation knowledge, all described in rdf and retrieved dynamically from the semantic web. with such a tool, na ve users can begin to discover, explore, and utilize semantic web data and services. because data and  services  are  accessed  directly  through  a  standalone  client  and not through a central point of access (e.g., a portal), new content and services can be consumed as soon as they become available. in this way we take advantage of an important sociological force that  encourages the production of new semantic web content by remaining faithful to the decentralized nature of the web.
