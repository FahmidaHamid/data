the rapid growth of the web has been noted and tracked extensively. recent studies have however documented the dual phenomenon web pages have small half lives, and thus the web exhibits rapid death as well. consequently, page creators are faced with an increasingly burdensome task of keeping links up-to-date, and many are falling behind. in addition to just individual pages, collections of pages or even entire neighborhoods of the web exhibit signi cant decay, rendering them less e ective as information resources. such neighborhoods are identi ed only by frustrated searchers, seeking a way out of these stale neighborhoods, back to more up-to-date sections of the web; measuring the decay of a page purely on the basis of dead links on the page is too naive to re ect this frustration. in this paper we formalize a strong notion of a decay measure and present algorithms for computing it e ciently. we explore this measure by presenting a number of validations, and use it to identify interesting artifacts on today s web. we then describe a number of applications of such a measure to search engines, web page maintainers, ontologists, and individual users.
