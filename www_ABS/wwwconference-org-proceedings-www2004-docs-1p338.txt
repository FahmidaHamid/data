delivering  web  pages  to  mobile  phones  or  personal  digital assistants has become possible with the latest wireless technology. however, mobile devices have very small screen sizes and memory capacities. converting web pages for delivery to a mobile device is an exciting new problem. in this paper, we propose to use a ranking algorithm  similar  to  google s  pagerank  algorithm  to  rank  the content  objects  within  a  web  page.  this  allows  the  extraction  of only important parts of web pages for delivery to mobile devices. experiments show that the new method is effective. in experiments on  pages  from  randomly  selected  websites,  the  system  needed  to extract and deliver only 39% of the objects in a web page in order to  provide  85%  of  a  viewer s  desired  viewing  content.  this provides significant savings in the wireless traffic and downloading time  while  providing  a  satisfactory  reading  experience  on  the mobile device. categories & subject descriptors h.4.3 [communications applications] communications applications - information browsers; h.5.2 [user interfaces] user interfaces - graphical user interfaces (gui);
