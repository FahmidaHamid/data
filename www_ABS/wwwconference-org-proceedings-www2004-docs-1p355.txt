automatically generated html, as produced by wysiwyg programs, typically contains much repetitive and unnecessary markup. this paper identi es aspects of such html that may be altered while leaving a semantically equivalent document, and proposes techniques to achieve optimizing modi cations. these techniques include attribute rearrangement via dynamic programming, the use of style classes, and dead-code removal. these techniques produce documents as small as 33% of original size. the size decreases obtained are still signi cant when the techniques are used in combination with conventional text-based compression.
