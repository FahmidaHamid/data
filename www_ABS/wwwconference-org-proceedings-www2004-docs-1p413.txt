current search technologies work in  one size  ts all  fashion. therefore, the answer to a query is independent of speci c user information need. in this paper, we describe a novel ranking technique for personalized search services that combines content-based and community-based evidences. the community-based information is used in order to provide context for queries and is in uenced by the current interaction of the user with the service. our algorithm is evaluated using data derived from an actual service available on the web, an online bookstore. we show that the quality of content-based ranking strategies can be improved by the use of community information as another evidential source of relevance. in our experiments, the improvements reach up to 48% in terms of average precision.
