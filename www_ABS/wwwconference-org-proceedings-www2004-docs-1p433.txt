researchers in web engineering have regularly noted that existing web application development environments provide little support for managing the evolution of web applications. key limitations of web development environments include line-oriented change models that inadequately represent web document semantics and inability to model changes to link structure or the set of objects making up the web application. developers may  nd it dif cult to grasp how the overall structure of the web application has changed over time and may respond by using ad hoc solutions that lead to problems of maintainability, quality and reliability. web applications are software artifacts, and as such, can bene- t from advanced version control and software con guration management (scm) technologies from software engineering. we have modi ed an integrated development environment to manage the evolution and maintenance of web applications. the resulting environment is distinguished by its  ne-grained version control framework,  ne-grained web content change management, and product versioning con guration management, in which a web project can be organized at the logical level and its structure and components are versioned in a  ne-grained manner as well. this paper describes the motivation for this environment as well as its user interfaces, features, and implementation.
