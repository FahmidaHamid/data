for the manual semantic markup of documents to become widespread, users must be able to express annotations that conform to ontologies  (or  schemas)  that  have  shared  meaning.    however,  a typical user is unlikely to be familiar with the details of the terms as  defined  by  the  ontology  authors.    in  addition,  the  idea  to  be expressed  may  not  fit  perfectly  within  a  predefined  ontology. the ideal tool should help users find a partial formalization that closely follows the ontology where possible but deviates from the formal representation where needed. we describe an implemented approach semantic annotations  for  a  document  according  to  an  extensible  owl ontology. in our approach, users enter a short sentence in free text to describe all or part of a document, and the system presents a set of  potential  paraphrases  of  the  sentence  that  are  generated  from valid  expressions  in  the  ontology,  from  which  the  user  chooses the closest match. we use a combination of off-the-shelf parsing tools  and  breadth-first  search  of  expressions  in  the  ontology  to help  users  create  valid  annotations  starting  from  free  text.  the user  can  also  define  new  terms  to augment the ontology, so the potential matches can improve over time. to  help  users  create semi-structured
