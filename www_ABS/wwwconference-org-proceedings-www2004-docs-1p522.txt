this paper presents a systematic study of the properties of a large number of web sites hosted by a major isp. to our knowledge, ours is the  rst comprehensive study of a large server farm that contains thousands of commercial web sites. we also perform a simulation analysis to estimate potential performance bene ts of content delivery networks (cdns) for these web sites. we make several interesting observations about the current usage of web technologies and web site performance characteristics. first, compared with previous client workload studies, the web server farm workload contains a much higher degree of un-cacheable responses and responses that require mandatory cache validations. a signi cant reason for this is that cookie use is prevalent among our population, especially among more popular sites. we found an indication of widespread indiscriminate usage of cookies, which unnecessarily impedes the use of many content delivery optimizations. we also found that most web sites do not utilize the cache-control features of the http 1.1 protocol, resulting in suboptimal performance. moreover, the implicit expiration time in client caches for responses is constrained by the maximum values allowed in the squid proxy. finally, our simulation results indicate that most web sites bene t from the use of a cdn. the amount of the bene t depends on site popularity and, somewhat surprisingly, a cdn may increase the peak to average request ratio at the origin server because the cdn can decrease the average request rate more than the peak request rate.
