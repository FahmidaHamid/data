one of the key bene ts of xml is its ability to represent a mix of structured and unstructured (text) data. although current xml query languages such as xpath and xquery can express rich queries over structured data, they can only express very rudimentary queries over text data. we thus propose texquery, which is a powerful full-text search extension to xquery. texquery provides a rich set of fully compos-able full-text search primitives, such as boolean connectives, phrase matching, proximity distance, stemming and thesauri. texquery also enables users to seamlessly query over both structured and text data by embedding texquery primitives in xquery, and vice versa. finally, texquery supports a  ex-ible scoring construct that can be used to score query results based on full-text predicates. texquery is the precursor of the full-text language extensions to xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 currently being developed by the w3c.
