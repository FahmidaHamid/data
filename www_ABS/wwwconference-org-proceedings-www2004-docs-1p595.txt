studying web graphs is often dif(cid2)cult due to their large size. recently, several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow to store a web graph in memory in a limited space, exploiting the inner redundancies of the web. the web-graph framework is a suite of codes, algorithms and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs. this papers presents the compression techniques used in webgraph, which are centred around referentiation and intervalisation (which in turn are dual to each other). webgraph can compress the webbase graph (118 mnodes, 1 glinks) in as little as 308 bits per link, and its transposed version in as little as 289 bits per link.
