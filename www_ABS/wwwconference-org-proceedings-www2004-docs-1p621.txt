this paper presents a set of tools and techniques for analyzing interactions of composite web services which are speci-(cid12)ed in bpel and communicate through asynchronous xml messages. we model the interactions of composite web services as conversations, the global sequence of messages exchanged by the web services. as opposed to earlier work, our tool-set handles rich data manipulation via xpath expressions. this allows us to verify designs at a more detailed level and check properties about message content. we present a framework where bpel speci(cid12)cations of web services are translated to an intermediate representation, followed by the translation of the intermediate representation to a veri(cid12)cation language. as an intermediate representation we use guarded automata augmented with unbounded queues for incoming messages, where the guards are expressed as xpath expressions. as the target veri(cid12)cation language we use promela, input language of the model checker spin. since spin model checker is a (cid12)nite-state veri(cid12)ca-tion tool we can only achieve partial veri(cid12)cation by (cid12)xing the sizes of the input queues in the translation. we propose the concept of synchronizability to address this problem. we show that if a composite web service is synchronizable, then its conversation set remains same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. we give a set of su(cid14)cient conditions that guarantee syn-chronizability and that can be checked statically. based on our synchronizability results, we show that a large class of composite web services with unbounded input queues can be completely veri(cid12)ed using a (cid12)nite state model checker such as spin.
