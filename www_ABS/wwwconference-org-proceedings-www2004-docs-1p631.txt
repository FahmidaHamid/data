a technical infrastructure for storing, querying and managing rdf data is a key element in the current semantic web development. systems like jena, sesame or the ics-forth rdf suite are widely used for building semantic web applications. currently, none of these systems supports the integrated querying of distributed rdf repositories. we consider this a major shortcoming since the semantic web is distributed by nature. in this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed rdf repositories by extending the existing sesame system. we discuss the implications of our architecture and propose an index structure as well as algorithms for query processing and optimization in such a distributed context.
