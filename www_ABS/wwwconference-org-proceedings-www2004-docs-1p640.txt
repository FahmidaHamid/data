in peer-to-peer networks, (cid2)nding the appropriate answer for an information request, such as the answer to a query for rdf(s) data, depends on selecting the right peer in the network. we here investigate how social metaphors can be exploited effectively and ef(cid2)-ciently to solve this task. to this end, we de(cid2)ne a method for query routing, remindin , that lets (i) peers observe which queries are successfully answered by other peers, (ii) memorizes this observation, and, (iii) subsequently uses this information in order to select peers to forward requests to. remindin  has been implemented for the swap peer-to-peer platform as well as for a simulation environment. we have used the simulation environment in order to investigate how successful variations of remindin  are and how they compare to baseline strategies in terms of number of messages forwarded in the network and statements appropriately retrieved.
