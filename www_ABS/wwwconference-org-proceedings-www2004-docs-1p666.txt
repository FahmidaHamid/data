when searching large hypertext document collections, it is often possible that there are too many results available for ambiguous queries. query re nement is an interactive process of query modi- cation that can be used to narrow down the scope of search results. we propose a new method for automatically generating re nements or related terms to queries by mining anchor text for a large hypertext document collection. we show that the usage of anchor text as a basis for query re nement produces high quality re ne-ment suggestions that are signi cantly better in terms of perceived usefulness compared to re nements that are derived using the document content. furthermore, our study suggests that anchor text re nements can also be used to augment traditional query re ne-ment algorithms based on query logs, since they typically differ in coverage and produce different re nements. our results are based on experiments on an anchor text collection of a large corporate intranet.
