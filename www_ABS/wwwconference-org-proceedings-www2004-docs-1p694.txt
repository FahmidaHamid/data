reagents are remotely executing agents that customize web browsing for nonstandard resource-limited clients. a reagent is essentially a  one-shot  mobile agent that acts as an extension of a client, dynamically launched by the client to run on its behalf at a remote, more advantageous, location. reagents simplify the use of mobile agent technology by transparently handling data migration and run-time network communications, and provide a general interface for programmers to more easily implement their application-speci c customizing logic. this is made possible by the availability of remote behaviors, i.e., common patterns of actions that exploit the ability to process and communicate remotely. examples of such behaviors are transformers, monitors, cachers, and collators. in this paper, we identify a set of useful reagent behaviors for interacting with web services via a standard browser, describe how to program and use reagents, and show that the overhead of using reagents is low and outweighed by its bene ts.
