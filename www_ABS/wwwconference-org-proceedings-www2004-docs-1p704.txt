in the semantic web architecture, web ontology languages are built on top of rdf(s). however, serious dif culties have arisen when trying to layer expressive ontology languages, like owl, on top of rdf-schema. although these problems can be avoided, owl (and the whole semantic web architecture) becomes much more complex than it should be. in this paper, a possible simpli cation of the semantic web architecture is suggested, which has several important advantages with respect to the layering currently accepted by the w3c ontology working group.
