web  accessibility   however,  most approaches  to  its  attainment  are  based  on  unrealistic  economic models  in  which  web  content  developers  spend  too  much  and receive too little.   we believe this situation is due, in part, to the overly narrow definitions given both to those who stand to benefit from  enhanced  access  to  the  web  and  what  is  meant  by  this enhanced  access.    in  this  paper,  we  take  a  broader  view, discussing  an  approach  that  costs  developers  less  and  provides greater advantages to a larger community of users.  while we have quite  specific  aims  in  our  technical  work,  we  hope  it  can  also serve as an example of how the technical conversation regarding web  accessibility  can  move  beyond  the  narrow  confines  of limited adaptations for small populations.
