a requirements analysis in the emerging  eld of semantic web services (sws) (see http//daml.org/services/swsl/requirements/) has identi ed four major areas of research intelligent service discovery, automated contracting of services, process modeling, and service enactment. this paper deals with the intersection of two of these areas process modeling as it pertains to automated contracting. speci cally, we propose a logic, called ct rs, which captures the dynamic aspects of contracting for services. since ct rs is an extension of the classical  rst-order logic, it is well-suited to model the static aspects of contracting as well. a distinctive feature of contracting is that it involves two or more parties in a potentially adversarial situation. ct rs is designed to model this adversarial situation through its novel model theory, which incorporates certain game-theoretic concepts. in addition to the model theory, we develop a proof theory for ct rs and demonstrate the use of the logic for modeling and reasoning about web service contracts.
