this  paper  presents  a  novel  approach  of  using  web  log  data generated  by  course  management  systems  (cms)  to  help instructors  become  aware  of  what  is  happening  in  distance techniques  from  information learning  classes.  specifically, visualization  are  used render  complex, multidimensional  student  tracking  data  collected  by  cms.  a system,  called  coursevis,  illustrates  the  proposed  approach. graphical representations from the use of coursevis to visualise data  from  a  java  online  distance  course  ran  with  webct  are presented.  findings  from  the  evaluation  of  coursevis  are presented,  and  it  is  argued  that  coursevis  can  help  teachers become aware of some social, behavioural, and cognitive aspects related  to  distance  learners.  using  graphical  representations  of student tracking data, instructors can identify tendencies in their classes,  or  quickly  discover that  need  special attention. individuals
