content  delivery  networks  have  evolved  beyond  traditional distributed  caching. such  as  akamai's edgecomputing  it  is  now  possible  to  deploy  and  run  enterprise business  web  applications  on  a  globally  distributed  computing platform,  to  provide  subsecond  response  time  to  end  users anywhere in the world.  additionally, this distributed application platform provides high levels of fault-tolerance and scalability on-demand to meet virtually any need.  application resources can be provisioned  dynamically  in  seconds  to  respond  automatically  to changes in load on a given application. in some cases, an application can be deployed completely on the global  platform  without  any  central  enterprise  infrastructure. other applications can require centralizing core business logic and transactional  databases  at  the  enterprise  data  center  while  the presentation layer  and  some  business logic  and  database functionality move onto the edge platform. implementing  a  distributed  application  service  on  the  internet s edge including sandboxing  for  security,  distributed  load-balancing  and  resource management,  accounting  and  billing,  deployment, testing, debugging,  and  monitoring.    our  current  implementation  of akamai  edgecomputing  supports  application  programming platforms  such  as  java  2  enterprise  edition  (j2ee)  and microsoft s .net framework, in large part because they make it easier to address some of these challenges.  in the near future we will  also  support  environments  for  other  application  languages such as c, php, and perl. requires  overcoming  numerous  challenges,
