interoperability is one of the main issues in creating a networked system  of  repositories.  the  edusource  project  in  its  holistic approach to building a network of learning object repositories in canada is implementing an open network for learning services. its openness  is  supported  by  a  communication  protocol  called  the edusource  communications  layer (ecl)  which  closely implements  the  ims  digital  repository  interoperability  (dri) specification  and  architecture.  the  ecl  in  conjunction  with connection middleware enables any service providers to join the network. edusource is open to external initiatives as it explicitly supports  an  extensible  bridging  mechanism  between  edusource and  other  major  initiatives.  this  paper  discusses  interoperability in  general  and  then  focuses  on  the  design  of  ecl  as  an implementation  of  ims  dri  with  supporting  infrastructure  and middleware. the edusource implementation is in the mature state of  its  development  as  being  deployed  in  different  settings  with different  partners.  two  applications  used  in  evaluating  our approach  are  described  a  gateway  for  connecting  between edusource  and  the  nsdl  initiative,  and  a  federated  search connecting edusource, edna and smete.
