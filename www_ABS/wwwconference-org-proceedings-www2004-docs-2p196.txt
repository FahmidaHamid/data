we present enhancements for uddi / daml-s registries allowing  cooperative  discovery  and  selection  of  web  services  with  a focus on personalization. to find the most useful service in each instance of a request, not only explicit parameters of the request have  to  be  matched  against  the  service  offers.  also  user  preferences or implicit assumptions of a user with respect to common knowledge in a certain domain have to be considered to improve the  quality  of  service  provisioning.  in  the  area  of  web  services the notion of service ontologies together with cooperative answering  techniques  can  take  a  lot  of  this  responsibility.  however, without quality assessments for the relaxation of service requests and queries a personalized service discovery and selection is virtually  impossible.  this  paper  focuses  on  assessing  the  semantic meaning of query relaxation plans over multiple conceptual views of the service ontology, each one representing a soft query constraint of the user request. our focus is on the question what constitutes a minimum amount of necessary relaxation to answer each individual  request  in  a  cooperative  manner.  incorporating  such assessments as early as possible we propose to integrate ontology-based discovery directly into uddi directories or query facilities in  service  provisioning  portals.  using  the  quality  assessments presented  here,  this  integration  promises  to  propel  today s  web services towards an intuitive user-centered service provisioning.
