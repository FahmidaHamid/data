in  this  poster  we  introduce  prothes,  a  pilot  meta-search  engine (mse) for a specific application domain. prothes combines three approaches meta-search, graphical user interface (gui) for query specification,  and  thesaurus-based  query  techniques.  prothes attempts is represented  by  both  a  conceptual  thesaurus  and  results  ranking heuristics.  since the knowledge  representation  is separated from the mse core, adjusting the system to a specific domain is trouble free. thesaurus allows for manual query building and automatic query  techniques.  this  poster  outlines the  overall  system architecture, format,  and  query operations. prothes is implemented on j2ee platform as a web service. thesaurus representation
