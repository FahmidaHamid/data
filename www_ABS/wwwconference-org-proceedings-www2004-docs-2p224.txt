collaborative filtering (cf) technique has proved to be one of the most successful techniques in recommendation systems in recent years.  however,  traditional  centralized  cf  system  has  suffered from  its  shortage  in  scalability  as  their  calculation  complexity increases quickly both in time and space when the record in user database increases. in this paper, we propose a decentralized cf algorithm, called pipecf, based on distributed hash table (dht) method.  we  also  propose  two  novel  approaches  to  improve  the scalability and prediction accuracy of dht-based cf algorithm. the experimental data show that our dht-based cf system has better  prediction  accuracy,  efficiency  and  scalability than traditional cf systems.
