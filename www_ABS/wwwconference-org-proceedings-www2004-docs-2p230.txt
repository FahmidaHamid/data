interoperability has become one of the big problems of e-commerce since it was born. a number of b2b standards like ebxml, uddi, rosettanet, xcbl, etc. emerged recently to solve the interoper-ability problem. currently, there exists many b2b standards each provide competing and complementary solutions to b2b interoperability. so, there is a need for serving implementation of these standards from a single, central store to ease the use and management of the implementations. this paper presents eiop, an e-commerce interop-erability platform. eiop is designed to provide a central store for implementations of e-commerce speci cations to be able to use and con gure these implementations from a single, central point. it de- nes the term eiop component which corresponds to plug&play e-commerce applications that are stored in the eiop.
