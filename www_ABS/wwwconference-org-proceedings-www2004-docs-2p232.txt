defining  dependency  models  is  sometimes  an  easier,  more intuitive  way  for  ontology  representation  than  defining  reactive rules directly, as it provides a higher level of abstraction. we will shortly introduce the adi (active dependency integration) model capabilities, emphasizing new developments 1.  support  of  automatic  dependencies  instantiation  from  an abstract  definition  that  expresses  a  general  dependency  in  the ontology, namely a "template". 2.  inference  of  rules  for  dynamic  dependency  models,  where dependencies and entities may be inserted, deleted and updated. we  use  the  etrade  example  in  order  to  exemplify  those capabilities. categories & subject descriptors primary c.4 [computer systems organization] performance of systems   modeling techniques, measurement techniques. secondary c.3 [computer systems organization] special-purpose and application-based systems   signal processing systems.
