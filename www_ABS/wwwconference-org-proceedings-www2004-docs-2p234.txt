in this paper, we present a localized shortest path tree (spt) based algorithm for constructing a sub-network with the minimum-energy property  for  a  given  wireless  ad  hoc  network.  each  mobile  node determines  its  own  transmission  power  based  only  on  its  local information. the proposed algorithm constructs local shortest path trees  from  the  unit  disk  graph.  the  performance  improvements  of our algorithm are demonstrated through simulations.
