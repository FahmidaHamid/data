enterprises  today  wish  to  manage  their  it  resources  so  as  to optimize  business  objectives,  such  as  income,  rather  than  it metrics,  such  as  response  times.  therefore,  we  introduce  a  new paradigm,  which  focuses  on  such  business  objective  oriented resource  management.  additionally,  we  define  a  general simulation-based such optimizations,  and  describe  a  case  study,  demonstrating  the usefulness of such a process. categories & subject descriptors c.4 [performance of systems] modeling techniques and performance attributes. i.6 [simulation and modeling] i.6.3 applications and i.6.4 model validation and analysis.
