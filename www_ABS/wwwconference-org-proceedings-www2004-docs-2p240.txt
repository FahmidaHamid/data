conventionally,  web  pages  have  been  recognized  as  documents described  by  html.  image  data,  such  as  photographs,  logos, maps,  illustrations,  and  decorated  text,  have  been  treated  as sub-components  of  web  documents.  however,  we  can alternatively  recognize  all  web  pages  as  images  on  the  screen. when  a  web  page  is  treated  as  an  image,  its  html  data  is considered  to  be  metadata  which  describes  the  image  content. taking  such  a  viewpoint,  we  propose  a  new  image-based hypermedia which we call continuous web. in our model, there is no  distinction  between  web  images  and  other  images  such  as photographs. regarding everything on the web as images leads us to consider a new  style  of  browsing  and  navigating.  we  use  the  term scape-oriented  browsing.  we  define  a  scape  as  a  collection  of continuously  accumulated  images.  for  example,  whenever  we walk  in  the  real  world,  we  can  perceive  and  remember  various forms of information through a scape process. here, we describe new  methods  for  scape-oriented  browsing,  such  as  see-through anchors,  parallel  navigation,  and  peripheral  scape  presentation. we have designed and implemented a prototype system based on our model. our system offers continuous browsing and navigation to  users.  we  explain  our  concepts  and  discuss  the  effectiveness and potential of this approach.
