an  active  e-course  is  a  self-representable  and  self-organizable document  mechanism  with  a  flexible  structure.  the  kernel  of  the active  e-course  is  to  organize  learning  materials  into  a  "concept space" rather than a "page space". besides highly interactive service, it  supports  adaptive  learning  by  dynamically  selecting,  organizing and presenting the learning materials for different students. during the  learning  progress,  it  also  provides  assessments  on  students  learning  performances  and  gives  suggestions  to  guide  them  in further  learning.  we  have  implemented  an  authoring  tool  and  a course prototype to support the constructivist learning. categories & subject descriptors k.3.2 [computers and  education]  computer  and  information  science  education    computer science education, curriculum.
