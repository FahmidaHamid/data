in this paper, we propose a novel multicast streaming protocol for overlay networks, called gossip based streaming (gbs). in gbs, streaming  contents  are  not  come  from  a  single  upstream  source, but delivered from several sources to a client. though being similar  to  existing  gossip  protocols,  the  unique  requirements  for streaming, such as continuous playback, are addressed in our design. preliminary results show that gbs performs much better in dynamic user environments.
