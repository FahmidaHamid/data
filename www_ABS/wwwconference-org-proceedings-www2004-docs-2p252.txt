we propose a system called  adaptation anywhere & anytime(a3) , which is a framework for making web sites/applications adaptable to user s needs or interests, and we describe the implement of a web site on a3 by using xslt. web sites/applications built on a3 construct user ontologies for each user automatically and share them between sites/applications. each site/application uses the user ontology to select an appropriate resource for the user and to present such resources in a suitable form. and a3 offers the method for constructing the adaptable web sites using xslt. the author of web sites can easily make their sites adaptable by using xslt.
