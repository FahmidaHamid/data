in this paper, we propose a web based information sharing system called the proxy agent-based information sharing (pais). we also developed a writable web mechanism called web browser-based direct editing (wedit), that is a major component of pais. wedit enables public users to e ectively edit html text on an existing web browser. since wedit was developed with conventional technologies, users quickly learn how to use it. pais is implemented by using wedit and a proxy agent. pais enables users to share information via web pages using wedit. the proxy agent maintains users  editing data. the agent autonomously sends its user s modi cation data to other agents in the same community. in pais, certain con dential information in the community is not publicly shared by using the proxy agent.
