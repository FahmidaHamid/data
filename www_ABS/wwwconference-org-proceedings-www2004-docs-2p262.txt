uniform resource locators (urls), which mark the address of a resource on the world wide web, are often human-readable and can hint at the category of the resource. this paper explores the use of urls for web page categorization via a two-phase pipeline of word segmentation/expansion and classi cation. we quantify its performance against document-based methods, which require the retrieval of the source document.
