the future web can  be  imagined  as  a  life  network  consisting  of resource  nodes  and  semantic  relationship  links  between  them. any node has a life span from birth   adding it to the network   to death   removing it from the network. through establishing and investigating two types of models for such a network, we obtain the same scale free distribution of semantic links. simulations and comparisons validate the rationality of the proposed models.
