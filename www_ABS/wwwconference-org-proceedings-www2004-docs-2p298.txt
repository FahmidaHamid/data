fragment-based caching has been proposed as a promising technique for dynamic web content delivery and caching [2, 3, 4]. most of these approaches either assume the fragment-based content is served by web server automatically, or look at server-side caching only. there is no method of extracting fragments from an existing dynamic web content, which is of great importance to the success of fragment-based caching. also, current technologies for supporting dynamic fragments do not allow to take into account changes in fragment spatiality, which is a popular technique in dynamic and personalized web site design. this paper describes our effort to address these shortcomings. the  rst, dyca, a dynamic content adapter, is a tool for creating fragment-based content from original dynamic content. our second proposal is an augmentation to the esi standard that will allow it to support looking up fragment locations in a mapping table that comes attached with the template. this allows the fragments to move across the document without needing to reserve the template.
