we  present  a  context  ultra-sensitive  approach  based  on  two-step recommender systems (cusa-2-step-rec). our approach relies on a committee  of  profile-specific  neural  networks.  this  approach provides recommendations that are accurate and fast to train because only  the  urls  relevant  to  a  specific  profile  are  used  to  define  the architecture  of  each  network.  we  compare  the  proposed  approach with  collaborative  filtering  showing  that  our  approach  achieves higher coverage and precision while being faster, and requiring lower main  memory  at  recommendation  time.  while  most  recommenders are  inherently  context  sensitive,  our  approach  is  context  ultra-sensitive because a different recommendation model is designed for each profile separately. categories & subject descriptors h.2.8 [information systems] database management database applications   data mining.
