a fundamental task on the grid is to decide what jobs to run on what computing resources based on job or application requirements. our previous work on ontology-based matchmaking discusses a resource matchmaking mechanism using semantic web technologies. we extend our previous work to provide dynamic access to such matchmaking capability by building a persistent online matchmaking service. our implementation uses the globus toolkit for the grid service development, and exploits the monitoring and discovery service in the grid infrastructure to dynamically discover and update resource information. we describe the architecture of our semantic matchmaker service in the poster. keywords grid services; semantic web; networking and distributed web applications; resource allocation; resource selection
