theoretical analysis of the web graph is often used to improve the ef ciency of search engines. the pagerank algorithm, proposed by [5], is used by the google search engine [4] to improve the results of the queries. the purpose of this article is to describe an enhanced version of the algorithm using a realistic model for the back button. we introduce a limited history stack model (you cannot click more than m times in a row), and show that when m = 1, the computation of this back pagerank can be as fast as that of a standard pagerank.
