this  paper  describes  the  design  and  implementation  of  the edusource  communication  layer  (ecl)  protocol.  ecl  is  one outcome  of  a  pan-canadian  project  called  edusource  canada  to build  an  open  network  of  interoperable  digital  repositories.  the design  goal  was  to  achieve  a  highly  flexible,  easy-to-use,  and platform  independent  communication  layer  protocol  that  allows new and existing repositories to communicate and share resources across  a  network.  ecl  conforms  to  ims  digital  repository interoperability  (dri)  specifications  and  supports  four  main functions and request/deliver.  the  ecl  protocol  builds  on  the  latest  standards and  is  flexible  with  respect  to  metadata  schemas  and  repository contents.  to  support  easy  adoption  of  the  protocol  we  provide middleware  components  for  connecting  existing  systems.  the ecl  is  currently  used  in  the  edusource  network,  and  we  have begun work bridging with other interoperable initiatives such as open knowledge initiative (oki). based on our experience, ecl is truly flexible and easy to use. submit/store,  gather/expose search/expose,
