rsa is the most popular public-key cryptosystem on the web today but long-term trends such as the proliferation of smaller, simpler devices and increasing security needs will make continued reliance on rsa more challenging over time. we offer elliptic curve cryptography (ecc) as a suitable alternative and describe our integration of this technology into several key components of the web s security infrastructure. we also present experimental results quantifying the bene ts of using ecc for secure web transactions.
