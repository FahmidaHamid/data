mining user access patterns from a continuous stream of web-clicks presents new challenges over traditional web usage mining in a large static web-click database. modeling user access patterns as maximal forward  references,  we  present  a  single-pass  algorithm  streampath for  online  discovering  frequent  path  traversal  patterns  from  an extended prefix tree-based data structure which stores the compressed and essential information about user s moving histories in the stream. theoretical analysis and performance evaluation show that the space requirement of streampath is limited to a logarithmic boundary, and the execution time, compared with previous multiple-pass algorithms [2], is fast.
