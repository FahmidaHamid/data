this  paper  presents  a  system  for  efficient  data  transformations between  xml  and  relational  databases,  called  xml  data mediator  (xdm). transformation  by externalizing  the  specification  of  the  mapping  in  a  script  and using an efficient run-time engine that automates the conversion task.   the runtime engine is independent from the mapping script. a  parser  converts  a  mapping  script  into  an  internal  conversion object. for the mapping from relational to xml, we use a tagging tree as a conversion object inside the runtime engine, and use an sql outer-join scheme to combine multiple sql queries in order to reduce the number of backend relational database accesses. for the  mapping  from  xml  to  relational, the conversion object is a shredding tree, and we use an innovative algorithm to process the xml  as  a  stream  in  order  to  achieve  linear  complexity  with respect to the size of the xml document.
