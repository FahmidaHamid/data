many of today s web applications support just simple trial-and-error retrievals supply one set of parameters, obtain one set of results. for a user who wants to examine a number of alternative retrievals, this form of interaction is inconvenient and frustrating. it can be hard work to keep  nding and adjusting the parameter-speci cation widgets buried in a web page, and to remember or record each result set. moreover, when using diverse web applications in combination   transferring result data from one into the parameters for another   the lack of an easy way to automate that transfer merely increases the frustration. our solution is to integrate techniques for each of three key activities clipping elements from web pages to wrap an application; connecting wrapped applications using spreadsheet-like formulas; and cloning the interface elements so that several sets of parameters and results may be handled in parallel. we describe a prototype that implements this solution, showing how it enables rapid and  exible exploration of the resources accessible through user-chosen combinations of web applications. our aim in this work is to contribute to research on making optimal use of the wealth of information on the web, by providing interaction techniques that address very practical needs.
