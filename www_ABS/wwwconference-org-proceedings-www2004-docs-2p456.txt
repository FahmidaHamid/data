usually, the success of systems using automatic course sequencing depends strongly on careful authoring and foreseeing of all curriculum alternatives before any learning session even starts. we believe that tutors, starting from a simple generic curriculum, and assuming that they have the proper tools, can much easier create curriculum alternatives as immediate response to the current learning situation. in this paper we present a tool that provides a  exible environment for tutors allowing them to customize, and develop the curriculum on-the- y. however, since individual tutoring is quite expensive we shortly discuss possibilities for enabling automatic adjustment of course curriculum to learners  needs by combining on-the- y curriculum alternatives created by tutors with well-known automatic course sequencing techniques.
