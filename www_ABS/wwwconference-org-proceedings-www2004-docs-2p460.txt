in many web search applications, similarities between objects of one type (say, queries) can be affected by the similarities between their  interrelated  objects  of  another  type  (say,  web  pages),  and vice  versa.  we  propose  a  novel  framework  called  similarity spreading to take account of the interrelationship and improve the similarity calculation. experiment results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the accuracy of the similarity measurement of the objects in a search engine. categories & subject descriptors h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval] information search and  retrieval  -  search  process,  clustering;  h.2.8  [database management]  database  applications  -  data  mining;  i.5.3 [pattern recognition] clustering - similarity measures
