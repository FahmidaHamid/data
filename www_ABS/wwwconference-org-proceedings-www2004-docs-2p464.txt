the lack of standardised approaches in the development of web-based  systems  is  an  ongoing  issue  for  the  developers  of commercial software. to address this issue we proposes a hybrid development  framework  for  web-based  solutions  that  combines much  of  the  best  attributes  of  existing  frameworks  but  utilises open,  standardised  w3c  technologies  where  possible.  this framework called openmvc is an evolution of the model-view-controller  (mvc)  pattern.  an implementation of openmvc has been built over a 5-tier architecture using java and .net.
