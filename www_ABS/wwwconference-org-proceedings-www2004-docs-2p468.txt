distributed crawling has shown that it can overcome important limitations of the today s crawling paradigm. however, the optimal bene ts of this approach are usually limited to the sites hosting the crawler. in this work, we propose a location-aware method, called ipmicra, that utilizes an ip address hierarchy, and allows crawling of links in a near optimal location aware manner.
