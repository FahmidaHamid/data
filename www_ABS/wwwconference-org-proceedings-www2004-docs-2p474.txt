intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated their utility in a variety  of  domains.    however,  they  are  notoriously  resource intensive  to  build.    we  report  here  on  the  development  of  a software to declaratively  create  intelligent  tutors.    this  intelligent  tutor generator  creates  applications  with  rich  user  interaction  and powerful  theory-based  remediation  capabilities.  it  utilizes  the constraint  based  tutoring  paradigm  and  is  generic  enough  to create tutors in several domains. it is easily extensible through plugins.
