the increasing importance of unicode for text encoding implies a possible doubling of data storage space and data transmission time, with  a  corresponding  need  for  data  compression.    the  approach presented  in  this  paper  aims  to  reduce  the  storage  and  the transmission time for persian text files in web-based applications and internet. the basic idea here is to compute the most repetitive n-grams in the persian text and replace them by a single character in the user-defined sections of the unicode. the compression will be done on the server side once and the decompression process is eliminated completely. the rendering process in the browser will do  the  decompression.  there  is  no  need  for  any  additional program  or  add-ins  for  decompression  to  be  installed  on  the browser  or  client  side.  the  user  needs  only  to  download  the proper unicode font once. a genetic algorithm is utilized to select the most appropriate n-grams. in the best case, we have achieved 52.26  %  reduction  of  the  file  size.  the  method  is  general,  and applies equally well to english and other languages.
