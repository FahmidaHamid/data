this  paper  presents  automatic  generation  of  the  web  ontology language (owl) from an uml model. the solution is based on an  mda-defined  architecture  for  ontology  development  and  the ontology  uml  profile  (oup).  a  conversion,  that  we  present here,  transforms an ontology from its oup definition (i.e. xml metadata into  owl  description. accordingly,  we  illustrate  how  an  oup-developed  ontology  can be shared with ontological engineering tools (i.e. prot g ). interchange     xmi)
