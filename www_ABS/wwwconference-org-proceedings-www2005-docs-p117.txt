while that  querying  mechanisms  for  complex idea relationships  (otherwise  known  as  semantic  associations) should  be  integral  to  semantic  web  search  technologies  has recently  gained  some  ground,  the  issue  of  how  search  results will be ranked remains largely unaddressed. since it is expected that the number of relationships between entities in a knowledge base will be much larger than the number of entities themselves, the  likelihood  that  semantic  association searches would result in  an  overwhelming  number  of  results  for  users  is  increased, therefore  elevating  the  need  for  appropriate  ranking  schemes. furthermore,  it  is  unlikely  that  ranking  schemes  for  ranking entities (documents, resources, etc.) may be applied to complex structures such as semantic associations. in this paper, we present an approach that ranks results based on how  predictable  a  result  might  be  for  users.  it  is  based  on  a relevance  model  semrank,  which  is  a  rich  blend  of  semantic and that supports the novel idea of modulative searches, where users may vary  their  search  modes  to  effect  changes  in  the  ordering  of results  depending  on the infrastructure  used  in  the  ssark  system  to  support  the computation  of  semrank  values  for  resulting  semantic associations and their ordering.
