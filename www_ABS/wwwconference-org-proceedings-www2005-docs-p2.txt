we investigate the idea of  nding semantically related search engine queries based on their temporal correlation; in other words, we infer that two queries are related if their populari-ties behave similarly over time. to this end, we  rst de ne a new measure of the temporal correlation of two queries based on the correlation coe cient of their frequency functions. we then conduct extensive experiments using our measure on two massive query streams from the msn search engine, revealing that this technique can discover a wide range of semantically similar queries. finally, we develop a method of e ciently  nding the highest correlated queries for a given input query using far less space and time than the naive approach, making real-time implementation possible.
