in this work we present topic diversi cation, a novel method designed to balance and diversify personalized recommendation lists in order to re ect the user s complete spectrum of interests. though being detrimental to average accuracy, we show that our method improves user satisfaction with recommendation lists, in particular for lists generated using the common item-based collaborative  ltering algorithm. our work builds upon prior research on recommender systems, looking at properties of recommendation lists as entities in their own right rather than speci cally focusing on the accuracy of individual recommendations. we introduce the intra-list similarity metric to assess the topical diversity of recommendation lists and the topic diversi cation approach for decreasing the intra-list similarity. we evaluate our method using book recommendation data, including o ine analysis on 361, 349 ratings and an online study involving more than 2, 100 subjects.
