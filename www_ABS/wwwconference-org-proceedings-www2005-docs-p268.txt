this paper describes xsquirrel, a new xml query language that transforms a document into a sub-document, i.e. a tree where the root-to-leaf paths are a subset of the root-to-leaf paths from the original document. we show that this type of queries is extremely useful for various applications (e.g. web services) and that the currently existing query languages are poorly equipped to express, reason and evaluate such queries. in particular, we emphasize the need to be able to compose such queries. we present the xsquirrel language with its syntax, semantics and two language speci c operators, union and composition. for the evaluation of the language, we leverage well established query technologies by translating xsquirrel expressions into xpath programs, xquery queries or xslt stylesheets. we provide some experimental results that compare our various evaluation strategies. we also show the runtime ben-e ts of query composition over sequential evaluation.
