we present globedb, a system for hosting web applications that performs autonomic replication of application data. globedb offers data-intensive web applications the bene ts of low access la-tencies and reduced update traf c. the major distinction in our system compared to existing edge computing infrastructures is that the process of distribution and replication of application data is handled by the system automatically with very little manual administration. we show that signi cant performance gains can be obtained this way. performance evaluations with the tpc-w benchmark over an emulated wide-area network show that globedb reduces latencies by a factor of 4 compared to non-replicated systems and reduces update traf c by a factor of 6 compared to fully replicated systems.
