without the proliferation of formal semantic annotations, the semantic web is certainly doomed to failure. in earlier work we presented a new paradigm to avoid this the  self annotating web , in which globally available knowledge is used to annotate resources such as web pages. in particular, we presented a concrete method instantiating this paradigm, called pankow (pattern-based annotation through knowledge on the web). in pankow, a named entity to be annotated is put into several linguistic patterns that convey competing semantic meanings. the patterns that are matched most often on the web indicate the meaning of the named entity   leading to automatic or semiautomatic annotation. in this paper we present c-pankow (context-driven pankow), which alleviates several shortcomings of pankow. first, by downloading abstracts and processing them offline, we avoid the generation of large number of linguistic patterns and correspondingly large number of google queries. second, by linguistically analyzing and normalizing the downloaded abstracts, we increase the coverage of our pattern matching mechanism and overcome several limitations of the earlier pattern generation process. third, we use the annotation context in order to distinguish the signi cance of a pattern match for the given annotation task. our experiments show that c-pankow inherits all the advantages of pankow (no training required etc.), but in addition it is far more ef cient and effective.
