we present a usage consultation tool, based on internet searching, for language learners. when a user enters a string of words for which he wants to (cid12)nd usages, the system sends this string as a query to a search engine and obtains search results about the string. the usages are extracted by performing statistical analysis on snippets and then fed back to the user. unlike existing tools, this usage consultation tool is multilingual, so that usages can be obtained even in a language for which there are no well-established analytical methods. our evaluation has revealed that usages can be obtained more e(cid11)ectively than by only using a search engine directly. also, we have found that the resulting usage does not depend on the search engine for a prominent usage when the amount of data downloaded from the search engine is increased.
