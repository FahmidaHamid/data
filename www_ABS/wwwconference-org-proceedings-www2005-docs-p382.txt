as the competition of web search market increases, there is a high demand for personalized web search to conduct retrieval incorporating web users  information needs. this paper focuses on utilizing clickthrough data to improve web search. since millions of searches are conducted everyday, a search engine accumulates a large volume of clickthrough data, which records who submits queries and which pages he/she clicks on. the clickthrough data is highly sparse and contains di erent types of objects (user, query and web page), and the relationships among these objects are also very complicated. by performing analysis on these data, we attempt to discover web users  interests and the patterns that users locate information. in this paper, a novel approach cubesvd is proposed to improve web search. the clickthrough data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which we perform 3-mode analysis using the higher-order singular value decomposition technique to automatically capture the latent factors that govern the relations among these multi-type objects users, queries and web pages. a tensor reconstructed based on the cubesvd analysis re ects both the observed interactions among these objects and the implicit associations among them. therefore, web search activities can be carried out based on cubesvd analysis. experimental evaluations using a real-world data set collected from an msn search engine show that cubesvd achieves encouraging search results in comparison with some standard methods.
