there have been recent interests in studying the \goal" behind a user s web query, so that this goal can be used to improve the quality of a search engine s results. previous studies have mainly focused on using manual query-log investigation to identify web query goals. in this paper we study whether and how we can automate this goal-identi cation process. we  rst present our results from a human subject study that strongly indicate the feasibility of automatic query-goal identi cation. we then propose two types of features for the goal-identi cation task user-click behavior and anchor-link distribution. our experimental evaluation shows that by combining these features we can correctly identify the goals for 90% of the queries studied.
