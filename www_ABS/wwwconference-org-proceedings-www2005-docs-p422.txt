reputation systems have been popular in estimating the trustworthiness and predicting the future behavior of nodes in a large-scale distributed system where nodes may transact with one another without prior knowledge or experience. one of the fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by malicious nodes. in this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose trustguard (cid0) a safeguard framework for providing a highly dependable and yet e(cid14)cient reputation system. first, we provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. second, a transaction based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by (cid13)ooding feedbacks with fake transactions. third, but not least, we identify the importance of (cid12)ltering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the feedbacks (cid12)led by malicious nodes through collusion. our experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation systems, our framework is highly dependable and e(cid11)ec-tive in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior, (cid13)ooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions, and dishonest feedbacks.
