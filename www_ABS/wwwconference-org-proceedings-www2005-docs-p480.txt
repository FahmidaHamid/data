website  privacy  policies  state  the  ways  that  a  site  will  use personal identifiable information (pii) that is collected from fields and forms in web-based transactions. since these policies can be complex,  machine-readable  versions  have  been  developed  that allow  automatic  comparison  of  a  site s  privacy  policy  with  a user s privacy preferences. however, it is still difficult for users to  determine  the  cause  and  origin  of  conformance  conflicts, because  current  standards  operate  at  the  page  level     they  can only say that there is a conflict on the page, not where the conflict occurs  or  what  causes  it.  in  this  paper  we  describe  fine-grained policy anchors, an extension to the way a website implements the platform for privacy preferences (p3p), that solves this problem. fine  grained  policy  anchors  enable  field-level  comparisons  of policy  and  preference,  field-specific  conformance  displays,  and faster  access  to  additional  conformance  information.  we  built  a prototype user agent based on these extensions and tested it with representative users. we found that fine-grained anchors do help users  understand  how  privacy  policy  relates  to  their  privacy preferences, and where and why conformance conflicts occur.
