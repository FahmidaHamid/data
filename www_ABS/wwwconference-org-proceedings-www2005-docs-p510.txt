we o er the  rst large-scale analysis of web tra c based on network  ow data. using data collected on the inter-net2 network, we constructed a weighted bipartite client-server host graph containing more than 18   106 vertices and 68   106 edges valued by relative tra c  ows. when considered as a tra c map of the worldwide web, the generated graph provides valuable information on the statistical patterns that characterize the global information  ow on the web. statistical analysis shows that client-server connections and tra c  ows exhibit heavy-tailed probability distributions lacking any typical scale. in particular, the absence of an intrinsic average in some of the distributions implies the absence of a prototypical scale appropriate for server design, web-centric network design, or tra c modeling. the inspection of the amount of tra c handled by clients and servers and their number of connections highlights nontrivial correlations between information  ow and patterns of connectivity as well as the presence of anomalous statistical patterns related to the behavior of users on the web. the results presented here may impact considerably the modeling, scalability analysis, and behavioral study of web applications.
