in this paper, we study the media workload collected from a large number of commercial web sites hosted by a major isp and that collected from a large group of home users connected to the internet via a well-known cable company. some of our key (cid12)ndings are (1) surprisingly, the majority of media contents are still delivered via downloading from web servers. (2) a substantial percentage of media downloading connections are aborted before completion due to the long waiting time. (3) a hybrid approach, pseudo streaming, is used by clients to imitate real streaming. (4) the mismatch between the downloading rate and the client playback speed in pseudo streaming is common, which either causes frequent playback delays to the clients, or unnecessary tra(cid14)c to the internet. (5) compared with streaming, downloading and pseudo streaming are neither bandwidth e(cid14)cient nor performance e(cid11)ective. to address this problem, we propose the design of autostream, an innovative system that can provide additional previewing and streaming services automatically for media objects hosted on standard web sites in server farms at the client s will.
