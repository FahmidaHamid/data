in  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  development  of  a  framework  for automatic  metadata  generation.  the  first  step this framework is the definition of an application programmer interface (api),  which  we  call  the  simple  indexing  interface  (sii).    the second step is the definition of a framework for implementation of the  sii.  both  steps  are  presented  in  some detail in this paper. we also report on empirical evaluation of the metadata that the sii and supporting framework generated in a real-life context.
