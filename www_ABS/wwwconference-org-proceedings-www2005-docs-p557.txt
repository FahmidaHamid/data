pagerank is de ned as the stationary state of a markov chain. the chain is obtained by perturbing the transition matrix induced by a web graph with a damping factor   that spreads uniformly part of the rank. the choice of   is eminently empirical, and in most cases the original suggestion   d 085 by brin and page is still used. recently, however, the behaviour of pagerank with respect to changes in   was discovered to be useful in link-spam detection [21]. moreover, an analytical justi cation of the value chosen for   is still missing. in this paper, we give the  rst mathematical analysis of pagerank when   changes. in particular, we show that, contrarily to popular belief, for real-world graphs values of   close to 1 do not give a more meaningful ranking. then, we give closed-form formulae for pagerank derivatives of any order, and an extension of the power method that approximates them with convergence o tk  t  for the k-th derivative. finally, we show a tight connection between iterated computation and analytical behaviour by proving that the k-th iteration of the power method gives exactly the pagerank value obtained using a maclaurin polynomial of degree k. the latter result paves the way towards the application of analytical methods to the study of pagerank.
