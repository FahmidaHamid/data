as an increasingly large number of owl ontologies become available on the semantic web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more complicated,  nding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task even for experts. existing ontology development environments provide some limited support, in conjunction with a reasoner, for detecting and diagnosing errors in owl ontologies. typically these are restricted to the mere detection of, for example, unsat-is able concepts. we have integrated a number of simple debugging cues generated from our description logic reasoner, pellet, in our hypertextual ontology development environment, swoop. these cues, in conjunction with extensive undo/redo and annotea based collaboration support in swoop, signi cantly improve the owl debugging experience, and point the way to more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology to new users.
