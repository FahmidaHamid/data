we introduce a stricter web community de nition to overcome boundary ambiguity of a web community de ned by flake, lawrence and giles [2], and consider the problem of  nding communities that satisfy our de nition. we discuss how to  nd such communities and hardness of this problem. we also propose web page partitioning by equivalence relation de ned using the class of communities of our de ni-tion. though the problem of e ciently  nding all communities of our de nition is np-complete, we propose an e cient method of  nding a subclass of communities among the sets partitioned by each of n   1 cuts represented by a gomory-hu tree [10], and partitioning a web graph by equivalence relation de ned using the subclass. according to our preliminary experiments, partitioning by our method divided the pages retrieved by keyword search into several di erent categories to some extent.
