on an abstract level, xml schema increases the limited expressive power of document type de nitions (dtds) by extending them with a recursive typing mechanism. however, an investigation of the xml schema de nitions (xsds) occurring in practice reveals that the vast majority of them are structurally equivalent to dtds. this might be due to the complexity of the xml schema speci cation and the di culty to understand the e ect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas. to shed some light on the actual expressive power of xsds this paper studies the impact of the element declarations consistent (edc) and the unique particle attribution (upa) rule. an equivalent formalism based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types is proposed which might serve as a lightweight front end for xml schema. finally, the e ect of edc and upa on the way xml documents can be typed is discussed. it is argued that a cleaner, more robust, stronger but equally ef- cient class is obtained by replacing edc and upa with the notion of 1-pass preorder typing schemas that allow to determine the type of an element of a streaming document when its opening tag is met. this notion can be de ned in terms of restrained competition regular expressions and there is again an equivalent syntactical formalism based on contextual patterns.
