we present a design for veri cation approach to developing reliable web services. we focus on composite web services which consist of asynchronously communicating peers. our goal is to automatically verify properties of interactions among such peers. we propose a design pattern that eases the development of such web services and enables a modular, assume-guarantee style veri cation strategy. in the proposed design pattern, each peer is associated with a behavioral interface description which speci es how that peer will interact with other peers. using these peer interfaces we automatically generate bpel speci cations to publish for interoperability. assuming that the participating peers behave according to their interfaces, we verify safety and liveness properties about the global behavior of the composite web service during behavior veri cation. during interface veri cation, we check that each peer implementation conforms to its interface. using the modularity in the proposed design pattern, we are able to perform the interface veri- cation of each peer and the behavior veri cation as separate steps. our experiments show that, using this modular approach, one can automatically and ef ciently verify web service implementations.
