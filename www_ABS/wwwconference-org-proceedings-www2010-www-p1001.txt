a  significant  portion  of  web  search  queries  are  name  entity  queries. the major search engines have been exploring various ways to provide better user experiences for name entity queries, such as showing  search tasks  (bing search) and showing direct answers (yahoo!,  kosmix).  in  order  to  provide  the  search  tasks  or  direct answers  that  can  satisfy  most  popular  user  intents,  we  need  to capture these intents, together with relationships between them. in this paper we propose an approach for building a hierarchical taxonomy of the generic search intents for a class of name entities (e.g., musicians or cities). the proposed approach can find phrases representing generic intents from user queries, and organize these phrases into a tree, so that phrases indicating equivalent or similar meanings are on the same node, and the parent-child relationships of  tree  nodes  represent  the  relationships  between  search  intents and  their  sub-intents.  three  different  methods  are  proposed  for tree  building,  which  are  based  on  directed  maximum  spanning tree,  hierarchical  agglomerative  clustering,  and  pachinko  allocation model. our approaches are purely based on search logs, and do  not  utilize  any  existing  taxonomies  such  as  wikipedia.  with the  evaluation  by  human  judges  (via  mechanical  turk),  it  is shown that our approaches can build trees of phrases that capture the relationships between important search intents.
