many have speculated that classifying web pages can improve a search engine s ranking of results. intuitively results should be more relevant when they match the class of a query. we present a simple framework for classi cation-enhanced ranking that uses clicks in combination with the classi cation of web pages to derive a class distribution for the query. we then go on to de ne a variety of features that capture the match between the class distributions of a web page and a query, the ambiguity of a query, and the coverage of a retrieved result relative to a query s set of classes. experimental results demonstrate that a ranker learned with these features signi cantly improves ranking over a competitive baseline. furthermore, our methodology is agnostic with respect to the classi cation space and can be used to derive query classes for a variety of di erent taxonomies.
