in this paper we propose the liquid query paradigm, to support users  in  finding  responses  to  multi-domain  queries  through exploratory  information  seeking  across  structured  information sources  (web  documents,  deep  web  data,  and  personal  data repositories),  wrapped  by  means  of  a  uniform  notion  of  search service.  liquid  query  aims  at  filling  the  gap  between  general-purpose  search  engines,  which  are  unable  to  find  information spanning  multiple  topics,  and  domain-specific  search  systems, which  cannot  go  beyond  their  domain  limits.  the  liquid  query interface  consists  of  interaction  primitives  that  let  users  pose questions  and  explore  results  spanning  over  multiple  sources incrementally,  thus  getting  closer  and  closer  to  the  sought information. we demonstrate our approach with a prototype built upon the yql (yahoo! query language) framework.
