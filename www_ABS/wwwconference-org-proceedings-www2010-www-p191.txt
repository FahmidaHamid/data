traditionally web applications have required an internet connection in order to work with data. browsers have lacked any mechanisms to allow web applications to operate o ine with a set of data to provide constant access to applications. recently, through browser plugins such as google gears, browsers have gained the ability to persist data for o ine use. however, until now it s been di cult for a web developer using these plugins to manage persisting data both locally for o ine use and in the internet cloud due to synchronization requirements, managing throughput and latency to the cloud, and making it work within the con nes of a standards-compliant web browser. historically in non-browser environments, programming language environments have o ered automated object persistence to shield the developer from these complexities. in our research we have created a framework which introduces automated persistence of data objects for javascript utilizing the internet. unlike traditional object persistence solutions, ours relies only on existing or forthcoming internet standards and does not rely upon speci c runtime mechanisms such as os or in-terpreter/compiler support. a new design was required in order to be suitable to the internet s unique characteristics of varying connection quality and a browser s speci c restrictions. we validate our approach using benchmarks which show that our framework can handle thousands of data objects automatically, reducing the amount of work needed by developers to support o ine web applications.
