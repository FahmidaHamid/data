community question answering (cqa) has emerged as a popular type of service where users ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer pairs. cqa archives contain very large volumes of questions organized into a hierarchy of categories. as an essential function of cqa services, question retrieval in a cqa archive aims to retrieve historical question-answer pairs that are relevant to a query question. in this paper, we present a new approach to exploiting category information of questions for improving the performance of question retrieval, and we apply the approach to existing question retrieval models, including a state-of-the-art question retrieval model. experiments conducted on real cqa data demonstrate that the proposed techniques are capable of outperforming a variety of baseline methods signi cantly.
