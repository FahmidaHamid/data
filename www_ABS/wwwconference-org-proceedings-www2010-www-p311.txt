web search engines use the full-text inverted index data structure. because query processing performance is impacted by the size of the inverted index, a plethora of research has focused on fast and effective techniques for compressing this structure. recently, researchers have proposed techniques for improving index compression by optimizing the assignment of document identi ers in the collection, leading to signi cant reduction in overall index size. in this paper, we propose improved techniques for document identi er assignment. previous work includes simple and fast heuristics such as sorting by url, as well as more involved approaches based on the traveling salesman problem or on graph partitioning. these techniques achieve good compression but do not scale to larger document collections. we propose a new framework based on performing a traveling salesman computation on a reduced sparse graph obtained through locality sensitive hashing. this technique achieves improved compression while scaling to tens of millions of documents. based on this framework, we describe new algorithms, and perform a detailed evaluation on three large data sets showing improvements in index size.
