addressing user s information needs has been one of the main goals of web search engines since their early days. in some cases, users cannot see their needs immediately answered by search results, simply because these needs are too complex and involve multiple aspects that are not covered by a single web or search results page. this typically happens when users investigate a certain topic in domains such as education, travel or health, which often require collecting facts and information from many pages. we refer to this type of activities as  research missions . these research missions account for 10% of users  sessions and more than 25% of all query volume, as veri ed by a manual analysis that was conducted by yahoo! editors. we demonstrate in this paper that such missions can be automatically identi ed on-the- y, as the user interacts with the search engine, through careful runtime analysis of query  ows and query sessions. the on-the- y automatic identi cation of research missions has been implemented in search pad, a novel yahoo! application that was launched in 2009, and that we present in this paper. search pad helps users keeping trace of results they have consulted. its novelty however is that unlike previous notes taking products, it is automatically triggered only when the system decides, with a fair level of con dence, that the user is undertaking a research mission and thus is in the right context for gathering notes. beyond the search pad speci c application, we believe that changing the level of granularity of query modeling, from an isolated query to a list of queries pertaining to the same research missions, so as to better re ect a certain type of information needs, can be bene cial in a number of other web search applications. session-awareness is growing and it is likely to play, in the near future, a fundamental role in many online tasks this paper presents a  rst step on this path.
