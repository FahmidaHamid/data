when online ads are shown together, they compete for user attention and conversions, imposing negative externalities on each other. while the competition for user attention in sponsored search can be captured via models of click-through rates, the post-click competition for conversions cannot since the value-per-click of an advertiser is proportional to the conversion probability conditional on a click, which depends on the other ads displayed, the private value of an advertiser is no longer one-dimensional, and the gsp mechanism is not adequately expressive. we study the design of expressive gsp-like mechanisms for the simplest form that an advertiser s private value can have in the presence of such externalities  an advertiser s value depends on exclusivity, i.e., whether her ad is shown exclusively, or along with other ads. our auctions take as input two-dimensional (per-click) bids for exclusive and nonexclusive display, and have two types of outcomes either a single ad is displayed exclusively, or multiple ads are simultaneously shown. we design two expressive auctions that are both extensions of gsp  the  rst auction, gsp2d, is designed with the property that the allocation and pricing are identical to gsp when multiple ads are shown; the second auction, n p2d, is designed to be a next price auction. we show that both auctions have high ef- ciency and revenue in all reasonable equilibria; further, the n p2d auction is guaranteed to always have an equilibrium with revenue at least as much as the current gsp mechanism. however, we  nd that unlike with one-dimensional valuations, the gsp-like auctions for these richer valuations do not always preserve e ciency and revenue with respect to the vcg mechanism.
