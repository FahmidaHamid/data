pagerank computes the importance of each node in a directed graph under a random surfer model governed by a teleportation parameter. commonly denoted alpha, this parameter models the probability of following an edge inside the graph or, when the graph comes from a network of web pages and links, clicking a link on a web page. we empirically measure the teleportation parameter based on browser toolbar logs and a click trail analysis. for a particular user or machine, such analysis produces a value of alpha. we  nd that these values nicely  t a beta distribution with mean edge-following probability between 0.3 and 0.7, depending on the site. using these distributions, we compute pager-ank scores where pagerank is computed with respect to a distribution as the teleportation parameter, rather than a constant teleportation parameter. these new metrics are evaluated on the graph of pages in wikipedia.
