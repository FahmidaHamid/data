we present aardvark, a social search engine. with aardvark, users ask a question, either by instant message, email, web input, text message, or voice. aardvark then routes the question to the person in the user s extended social network most likely to be able to answer that question. as compared to a traditional web search engine, where the challenge lies in  nding the right document to satisfy a user s information need, the challenge in a social search engine like aardvark lies in  nding the right person to satisfy a user s information need. further, while trust in a traditional search engine is based on authority, in a social search engine like aardvark, trust is based on intimacy. we describe how these considerations inform the architecture, algorithms, and user interface of aardvark, and how they are re ected in the behavior of aardvark users.
