in modern web applications, style formatting and layout calculation often account for a substantial amount of local web page processing time.  in  this  paper 1,  we  present  two  novel  caches,  smart  style caching and layout caching, for web browsers. they cache stable style  data  and  layout  data  for  dom  (document  object  model) elements, and apply directly without recalculation when the same data is subsequently processed, possibly across different visits of a web  page.  redundant  computations  in  both  style  formatting  and layout  calculation  could  be  eliminated,  resulting  in  more  efficient local  web  page  processing.  the  proposed  cache  schemes  are  still applicable  and  effective  even  there  are  changes  in  the  dom structure  or  style  rules  of  a  web  page.  experiments  on  the  web pages of the top 25 web sites show that, in a subsequent visit of the same web page, the smart style caching scheme could reduce the style  formatting time  by  about  64%  on  average,  and  the combination  of  both  caching  schemes  could  reduce  the  layout calculation time by about 61% on average, with about 46% overall performance improvement on the local web page processing time. for  the  overall  performance  when  networking,  web  servers,  and local  web  page  processing  were  all  included,  our  cache  schemes could  improve  up  to  56%  when  browsing  these  web  sites  on  a desktop pc and up to 60% when browsing on a netbook.
