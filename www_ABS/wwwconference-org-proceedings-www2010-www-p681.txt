the web abounds with dyadic data that keeps increasing by every single second. previous work has repeatedly shown the usefulness of extracting the interaction structure inside dyadic data [21, 9, 8]. a commonly used tool in extracting the underlying structure is the matrix factorization, whose fame was further boosted in the net ix challenge [26]. when we were trying to replicate the same success on real-world web dyadic data, we were seriously challenged by the scal-ability of available tools. we therefore in this paper report our e orts on scaling up the nonnegative matrix factorization (nmf) technique. we show that by carefully partitioning the data and arranging the computations to maximize data locality and parallelism, factorizing a tens of millions by hundreds of millions matrix with billions of nonzero cells can be accomplished within tens of hours. this result effectively assures practitioners of the scalability of nmf on web-scale dyadic data.
