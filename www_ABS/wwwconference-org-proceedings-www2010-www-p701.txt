we propose a novel method, based on concepts from ex-pander graphs, to sample communities in networks. we show that our sampling method, unlike previous techniques, produces subgraphs representative of community structure in the original network. these generated subgraphs may be viewed as strati ed samples in that they consist of members from most or all communities in the network. using samples produced by our method, we show that the problem of community detection may be recast into a case of statistical relational learning. we empirically evaluate our approach against several real-world datasets and demonstrate that our sampling method can e ectively be used to infer and approximate community a liation in the larger network.
