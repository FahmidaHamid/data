in this paper, we present adheat, a social ad model considering user in uence in addition to relevance for matching ads. traditionally, ad placement employs the relevance model. such a model matches ads with web page content, user interests, or both. we have observed, however, on social networks that the relevance model su ers from two shortcomings. first, in uential users (users who contribute opinions) seldom click ads that are highly relevant to their expertise. second, because in uential users  contents and activities are attractive to other users, hint words summarizing their expertise and activities may be widely preferred. therefore, we propose adheat, which di uses hint words of in uential users to others and then matches ads for each user with aggregated hints. we performed experiments on a large online q&a community with half a million users. the experimental results show that adheat outperforms the relevance model on ctr (click through rate) by signi cant margins.
