with the rapid growth in the number of online web services, the problem of service adaptation has received significant attention. in matching and adaptation, the functional description of services including interface and data as well as behavioral descriptions are important. existing work on matching and adaptation focuses only on one aspect. in this paper, we present a semi-automated matching approach that considers both service descriptions. we introduce two protocol-aware service interface matching algorithms, i.e. depth-based interface matching and iterative reference-based interface matching. these algorithms re ne the results of interface matching by incorporating the ordering constraints imposed by business protocol de nitions on service operations. we have implemented a prototype and performed experiments using the speci cation of synthetic and real-world web services. experiments show that the proposed approaches lead to a signi cant improvement in the quality of matching between services.
