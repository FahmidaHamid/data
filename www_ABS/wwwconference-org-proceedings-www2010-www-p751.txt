sentiment classi cation aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative) of users publishing sentiment data (e.g., reviews, blogs). although traditional classi cation algorithms can be used to train sentiment classi ers from manually labeled text data, the labeling work can be time-consuming and expensive. meanwhile, users often use some different words when they express sentiment in different domains. if we directly apply a classi er trained in one domain to other domains, the performance will be very low due to the differences between these domains. in this work, we develop a general solution to sentiment classi- cation when we do not have any labels in a target domain but have some labeled data in a different domain, regarded as source domain. in this cross-domain sentiment classi cation setting, to bridge the gap between the domains, we propose a spectral feature alignment (sfa) algorithm to align domain-speci c words from different domains into uni ed clusters, with the help of domain-independent words as a bridge. in this way, the clusters can be used to reduce the gap between domain-speci c words of the two domains, which can be used to train sentiment classi ers in the target domain accurately. compared to previous approaches, sfa can discover a robust representation for cross-domain data by fully exploiting the relationship between the domain-speci c and domain-independent words via simultaneously co-clustering them in a common latent space. we perform extensive experiments on two real world datasets, and demonstrate that sfa signi cantly outperforms previous approaches to cross-domain sentiment classi cation.
