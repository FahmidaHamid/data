many web applications such as ad matching systems, vertical search engines, and page categorization systems require the identi cation of a particular type or class of pages on the web. the sheer number and diversity of the pages on the web, however, makes the problem of obtaining a good sample of the class of interest hard. in this paper, we describe a successfully deployed end-to-end system that starts from a biased training sample and makes use of several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms working in tandem, including a powerful active learning component, in order to achieve a good classi cation system. the system is evaluated on tra c from a real-world ad-matching platform and is shown to achieve high categorization e ectiveness with a signi cant reduction in editorial e ort and labeling time.
