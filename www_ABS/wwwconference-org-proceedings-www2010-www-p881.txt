when a web user s underlying information need is not clearly speci ed from the initial query, an e ective approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query. in this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for web search result diversi cation, which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspeci ed query. in particular, we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satis es each uncovered aspect and the extent to which di erent aspects are satis ed by the ranking as a whole. we thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the trec 2009 web track. moreover, we exploit query reformulations provided by three major web search engines (wses) as a means to uncover di erent query aspects. the results attest the e ec-tiveness of our framework when compared to state-of-the-art diversi cation approaches in the literature. additionally, by simulating an upper-bound query reformulation mechanism from o cial trec data, we draw useful insights regarding the e ectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the di erent wses in promoting diversity.
