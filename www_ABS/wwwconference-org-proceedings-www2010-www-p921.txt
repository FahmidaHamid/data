the last three years have seen a dramatic increase in both awareness and exploitation of web application vulnerabilities. 2008 and 2009 saw dozens of high-pro le attacks against websites using cross site scripting (xss) and cross site request forgery (csrf) for the purposes of information stealing, website defacement, malware planting, clickjacking, etc. while an ideal solution may be to develop web applications free from any exploitable vulnerabilities, real world security is usually provided in layers. we present content restrictions, and a content restrictions enforcement scheme called content security policy (csp), which intends to be one such layer. content restrictions allow site designers or server administrators to specify how content interacts on their web sites a security mechanism desperately needed by the untamed web. these content restrictions rules are activated and enforced by supporting web browsers when a policy is provided for a site via http, and we show how a system such as csp can be e ective to lock down sites and provide an early alert system for vulnerabilities on a web site. our scheme is also easily deployed, which is made evident by our prototype implementation in firefox and on the mozilla add-ons web site.
