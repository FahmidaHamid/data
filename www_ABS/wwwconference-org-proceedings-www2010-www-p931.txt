we introduce a new dissimilarity function for ranked lists, the expected weighted hoe ding distance, that has several advantages over current dissimilarity measures for ranked search results. first, it is easily customized for users who pay varying degrees of attention to websites at di erent ranks. second, unlike existing measures such as generalized kendall s tau, it is based on a true metric, preserving meaningful embeddings when visualization techniques like multidimensional scaling are applied. third, our measure can e ectively handle partial or missing rank information while retaining a probabilistic interpretation. finally, the measure can be made computationally tractable and we give a highly e cient algorithm for computing it. we then apply our new metric with multidimensional scaling to visualize and explore relationships between the result sets from different search engines, showing how the weighted hoe ding distance can distinguish important di erences in search engine behavior that are not apparent with other rank-distance metrics. such visualizations are highly e ective at summarizing and analyzing insights on which search engines to use, what search strategies users can employ, and how search results evolve over time. we demonstrate our techniques using a collection of popular search engines, a representative set of queries, and frequently used query manipulation methods.
