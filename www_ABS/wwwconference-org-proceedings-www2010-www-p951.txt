the transition of personal information management (pim) tools o  the desktop to the web presents an opportunity to augment these tools with capabilities provided by the wealth of real-time information readily available. in this paper, we describe a next-generation personal information assistance engine that lets end-users delegate to it various simple context and activity-reactive tasks and reminders. our system, atomate, treats rss/atom feeds from social networking and life-tracking sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple uni ed rdf world model representing people, places and things and their time-varying states and activities. combined with other information sources on the web, including the user s online calendar, web-based email client, news feeds and messaging services, atomate can be made to automatically carry out a variety of simple tasks for the user, ranging from context-aware  ltering and messaging, to sharing and social coordination actions. atomate s open architecture and world model easily accommodate new information sources and actions via the addition of feeds and web services. to make routine use of the system easy for non-programmers, atomate provides a constrained-input natural language interface (cnli) for behavior speci cation, and a direct-manipulation interface for inspecting and updating its world model.
