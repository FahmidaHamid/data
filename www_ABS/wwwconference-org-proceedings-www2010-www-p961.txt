this paper describes mediafaces, a system that enables faceted exploration of media collections. the system processes semi-structured information sources to extract objects and facets, e.g. the relationships between two objects. next, we rank the facets based on a statistical analysis of image search query logs, and the tagging behaviour of users annotating photos in flickr. for a given object of interest, we can then retrieve the top-k most relevant facets and present them to the user. the system is currently deployed in production by yahoo! s image search engine1. we present the system architecture, its main components, and the application of the system as part of the image search experience.
