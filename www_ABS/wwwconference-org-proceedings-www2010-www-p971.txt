we present content extraction via tag ratios (cetr)   a method to extract content text from diverse webpages by using the html document s tag ratios. we describe how to compute tag ratios on a line-by-line basis and then cluster the resulting histogram into content and non-content areas. initially, we  nd that the tag ratio histogram is not easily clustered because of its one-dimensionality; therefore we extend the original approach in order to model the data in two dimensions. next, we present a tailored clustering technique which operates on the two-dimensional model, and then evaluate our approach against a large set of alternative methods using standard accuracy, precision and recall metrics on a large and varied web corpus. finally, we show that, in most cases, cetr achieves better content extraction performance than existing methods, especially across varying web domains, languages and styles.
