we present a simple auction mechanism which extends the second-price auction with reserve and is truthful in expectation. this mechanism is particularly e ective in private value environments where the distribution of valuations are irregular. bidders can  buy-it-now , or alternatively  take-a-chance  where the top d bidders are equally likely to win. the randomized take-a-chance allocation incentivizes high valuation bidders to buy-it-now. we show that for a large class of valuations, this mechanism achieves similar allocations and revenues as myerson s optimal mechanism, and outperforms the second-price auction with reserve. in addition, we present an evaluation of bid data from microsoft s adecn platform. we  nd the valuations are irregular, and counterfactual experiments suggest our bin-tac mechanism would improve revenue by 11% relative to an optimal second-price mechanism with reserve.
