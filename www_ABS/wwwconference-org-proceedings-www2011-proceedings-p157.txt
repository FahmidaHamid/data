measuring the causal e ects of online advertising (adfx) on user behavior is important to the health of the www publishing industry. in this paper, using three controlled experiments, we show that observational data frequently lead to incorrect estimates of adfx. the reason, which we label  activity bias,  comes from the surprising amount of time-based correlation between the myriad activities that users undertake online. in experiment 1, users who are exposed to an ad on a given day are much more likely to engage in brand-relevant search queries as compared to their recent history for reasons that had nothing do with the advertisement. in experiment 2, we show that activity bias occurs for page views across diverse websites. in experiment 3, we track account sign-ups at a competitor s (of the advertiser) website and  nd that many more people sign-up on the day they saw an advertisement than on other days, but that the true  competitive e ect  was minimal. in all three experiments, exposure to a campaign signals doing  more of everything  in given period of time, making it di cult to  nd a suitable  matched control  using prior behavior. in such cases, the  match  is fundamentally di erent from the exposed group, and we show how and why observational methods lead to a massive overestimate of adfx in such circumstances.
