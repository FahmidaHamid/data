accessing  online  information  from  various  data  sources  has  become  a  necessary  part  of  our  everyday  life.  unfortunately  such information  is not  always  trustworthy,  as  different  sources  are  of very different qualities and often provide inaccurate and conflicting  information.  existing  approaches  attack  this  problem  using unsupervised learning methods, and try to infer the confidence of the data value and trustworthiness of each source from each other by assuming values provided by more sources are more accurate. however,  because  false  values  can  be  widespread  through  copying among different sources and out-of-date data often overwhelm up-to-date data, such bootstrapping methods are often ineffective. in this paper we propose a semi-supervised approach that finds true values with the help of ground truth data. such ground truth data,  even  in  very  small  amount,  can  greatly  help  us  identify trustworthy data sources. unlike existing studies that only provide iterative algorithms, we derive the optimal solution to our problem and  provide  an  iterative  algorithm  that  converges  to  it.  experiments  show  our  method  achieves  higher  accuracy  than  existing approaches,  and  it  can  be  applied  on  very  huge  data  sets  when implemented with mapreduce.
