ambiguous queries constitute a signi cant fraction of search instances and pose real challenges to web search engines. with current approaches the top results for these queries tend to be homogeneous, making it di cult for users interested in less popular aspects to  nd relevant documents. while existing research in search diversi cation o ers several solutions for introducing variety into the results, the majority of such work is predicated, implicitly or otherwise, on the assumption that a single relevant document will ful ll a user s information need, making them inadequate for many informational queries. in this paper we present a search-diversi cation algorithm particularly suitable for informational queries by explicitly modeling that the user may need more than one page to satisfy their need. this modeling enables our algorithm to make a well-informed tradeo  between a user s desire for multiple relevant documents, probabilistic information about an average user s interest in the subtopics of a multifaceted query, and uncertainty in classifying documents into those subtopics. we evaluate the e ec-tiveness of our algorithm against commercial search engine results and other modern ranking strategies, demonstrating notable improvement in multiple document scenarios.
