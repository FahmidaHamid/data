in this paper we study how to discover the evolution of topics over time in a time-stamped document collection. our approach is uniquely designed to capture the rich topology of topic evolution inherent in the corpus. instead of characterizing the evolving topics at  xed time points, we conceptually de ne a topic as a quantized unit of evolutionary change in content and discover topics with the time of their appearance in the corpus. discovered topics are then connected to form a topic evolution graph using a measure derived from the underlying document network. our approach allows in-homogeneous distribution of topics over time and does not impose any topological restriction in topic evolution graphs. we evaluate our algorithm on the acm corpus. the topic evolution graphs obtained from the acm corpus provide an e ective and concrete summary of the corpus with remarkably rich topology that are congruent to our background knowledge. in a  ner resolution, the graphs reveal concrete information about the corpus that were previously unknown to us, suggesting the utility of our approach as a navigational tool for the corpus.
