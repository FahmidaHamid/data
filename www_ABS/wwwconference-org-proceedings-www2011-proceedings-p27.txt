web  search  engines  have  historically  focused  on  connecting people  with  information  resources.  for  example,  if  a  person wanted  to  know  when  their  flight  to  hyderabad  was  leaving,  a search  engine  might  connect  them  with  the  airline  where  they could  find  flight  status  information.  however,  search  engines have recently begun to try to meet people s search needs directly, providing,  for  example,  flight  status  information  in  response  to queries that include an airline and a flight number. in this paper, we use large scale query log analysis to explore the challenges a search  engine  faces  when  trying  to  meet  an  information  need directly  in  the  search  result  page.  we  look  at  how  people's interaction  behavior  changes  when  inline  content  is  returned, finding  that  such  content  can  cannibalize  clicks  from  the algorithmic  results.  we  see  that  in  the  absence  of  interaction behavior, an individual's repeat search behavior can be useful in understanding  the  content's  value.  we  also  discuss  some  of  the ways  user  behavior  can  be  used  to  provide  insight  into  when inline  answers  might  better  trigger  and  what  types  of  additional information might be included in the results.
