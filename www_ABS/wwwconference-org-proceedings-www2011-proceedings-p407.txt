the maximum entropy method provides one technique for validating search engine e ectiveness measures. under this method, the value of an e ectiveness measure is used as a constraint to estimate the most likely distribution of relevant documents under a maximum entropy assumption. this inferred distribution may then be compared to the actual distribution to quantify the  informativeness  of the measure. the inferred distribution may also be used to estimate values for other e ectiveness measures. previous work focused on traditional e ectiveness measures, such as average precision. in this paper, we extend the maximum entropy method to the newer cascade and intent-aware e ectiveness measures by considering the dependency of the documents ranked in a results list. these measures are intended to re ect the novelty and diversity of search results in addition to the traditional relevance. our results indicate that intent-aware measures based on the cascade model are informative in terms of both inferring actual distribution and predicting the values of other retrieval measures.
