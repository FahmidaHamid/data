in this paper, we present a highly scalable algorithm for structurally clustering webpages for extraction. we show that, using only the urls of the webpages and simple content features, it is possible to cluster webpages e ectively and e ciently. at the heart of our techniques is a principled framework, based on the principles of information theory, that allows us to e ectively leverage the urls, and combine them with content and structural properties. using an extensive evaluation over several large full websites, we demonstrate the e ectiveness of our techniques, at a scale unattainable by previous techniques.
