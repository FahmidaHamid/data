the ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation, correction, etc. yet, no matter how much data is aggregated, the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare. as a result, most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries. we propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques (and in particular query recommendation) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions, as currently done in query ow graph models. as a simple example, if we recognize that  mon-tezuma  is a city in the rare query  montezuma surf  and if the rule  <city> surf   <city> beach  has been observed, we are able to o er  montezuma beach  as a recommendation, even if the two queries were never observed in a same session. we conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis,  rst via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology. our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24% using templates without penalizing quality. furthermore, for 36% of the 95m queries in our query  ow graph, which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations, we can now o er at least one recommendation in 98% of the cases.
