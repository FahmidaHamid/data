we present  turkalytics,  a novel analytics tool for human computation systems. turkalytics processes and reports logging events from workers in real-time and has been shown to scale to over one hundred thousand logging events per day. we present a state model for worker interaction that covers the mechanical turk (the scrap model) and a data model that demonstrates the diversity of data collected by turkalytics. we show that turkalytics is e ective at data collection, in spite of it being unobtrusive. lastly, we describe worker locations, browser environments, activity information, and other examples of data collected by our tool.
