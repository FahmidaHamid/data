recently answers for fact lookup queries have appeared on major search  engines.  for  example,  for  the  query  {barack  obama  date of birth} google directly shows  4 august 1961  above its regular results.  in  this  paper,  we  describe  facto,  an  end-to-end  system for answering fact lookup queries for web search. facto extracts structured data from tables on the web, aggregates and cleans such data  and  stores  them  in  a  database.  given  a  web  search  query, facto will decide if it asks for facts in this database, and provides the most confident answer when possible. facto achieves higher precision  and  comparable  coverage  comparing  with  the  fact  lookup  engines  by  google  and  ask.com,  although  facto  is  developed  by  a  very  small  team.  we  present  the  challenges  and  our solutions  in  developing  every  component  of  facto.  some  solutions  are  based  on  existing  technologies,  and  many  others  are novel approaches proposed by us.
