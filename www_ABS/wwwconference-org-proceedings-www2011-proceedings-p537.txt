targeting interest to match a user with services (e.g. news, products, games, advertisements) and predicting friendship to build connections among users are two fundamental tasks for social network systems. in this paper, we show that the information contained in interest networks (i.e. user-service interactions) and friendship networks (i.e. user-user connections) is highly correlated and mutually helpful. we propose a framework that exploits homophily to establish an integrated network linking a user to interested services and connecting di erent users with common interests, upon which both friendship and interests could be e ciently propagated. the proposed friendship-interest propagation (fip) framework devises a factor-based random walk model to explain friendship connections, and simultaneously it uses a coupled latent factor model to uncover interest interactions. we discuss the  exibility of the framework in the choices of loss objectives and regularization penalties and benchmark di er-ent variants on the yahoo! pulse social networking system. experiments demonstrate that by coupling friendship with interest, fip achieves much higher performance on both interest targeting and friendship prediction than systems using only one source of information.
