streams of events appear increasingly today in various web applications such as blogs, feeds, sensor data streams, geospa-tial information, online  nancial data, etc. event processing (ep) is concerned with timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events. state-of-the-art ep provides on-the- y analysis of event streams, but cannot combine streams with background knowledge and cannot perform reasoning tasks. on the other hand, semantic tools can e ectively handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon, but cannot deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams. to bridge the gap, we propose event processing sparql (ep-sparql) as a new language for complex events and stream reasoning. we provide syntax and formal semantics of the language and devise an e ective execution model for the proposed formalism. the execution model is grounded on logic programming, and features e ective event processing and inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge. we provide an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests to show the usefulness and e ectiveness of our approach.
