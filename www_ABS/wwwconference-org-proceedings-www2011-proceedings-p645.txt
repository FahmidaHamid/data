we propose a description-logic style extension of owl 2 with nominal schemas which can be used like  variable nominal classes  within axioms. this feature allows ontology languages to express arbitrary dl-safe rules (as expressible in swrl or rif) in their native syntax. we show that adding nominal schemas to owl 2 does not increase the worst-case reasoning complexity, and we identify a novel tractable language sroelv 3( , ) that is versatile enough to capture the lightweight languages owl el and owl rl.
