understanding  user  intent  from  her  sequential  search  behaviors, i.e. predicting the intent of each user query in a search session, is crucial for modern web search engines. however, due to the huge number  of  user  behavior  variables  and  coarse  level  intent  labels defined by human editors, it is very difficult to directly model user behavioral  dynamics  or  user  intent  dynamics  in  user  search sessions.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  novel  sparse  hidden-dynamic  conditional  random  fields  (shdcrf)  model  for  user intent  learning  from  their  search  sessions.  through  incorporating the  proposed  hidden  state  variables,  shdcrf  aims  to  learn  a substructure, i.e. a set of related hidden variables, for each intent label  and  they  are  used  to  model  the  intermediate  dynamics between  user  intent  labels  and  user  behavioral  variables.  in addition,  shdcrf  learns  a  sparse  relation  between  the  hidden variables  and  intent  labels  to  make  the  hidden  state  variables explainable.  extensive  experiment  results,  on  real  user  search sessions  from  a  popular  commercial  search  engine  show  that  the proposed  shdcrf  model  significantly  outperforms  in  terms  of intent  prediction  results  that  those  classical  solutions  such  as support vector machine (svm), conditional random field (crf) and latnet-dynamic conditional random field (ldcrf).
