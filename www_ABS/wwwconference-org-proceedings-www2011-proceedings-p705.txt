we study several longstanding questions in media communications research, in the context of the microblogging service twitter, regarding the production,  ow, and consumption of information. to do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of twitter known as  lists  to distinguish between elite users by which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations and ordinary users. based on this classi cation, we  nd a striking concentration of attention on twitter, in that roughly 50% of urls consumed are generated by just 20k elite users, where the media produces the most information, but celebrities are the most followed. we also  nd signi cant homophily within categories celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories. next we reexamine the classical  two-step  ow  theory of communications,  nding considerable support for it on twitter. third, we  nd that urls broadcast by di erent categories of users or containing di erent types of content exhibit systematically di erent lifespans. and  nally, we examine the attention paid by the di erent user categories to di erent news topics.
