synchronous  social  q&a  systems  exist  on  the  web  and  in  the enterprise  to  connect  people  with  questions  to  people  with  answers in real-time. in such systems, askers  desire for quick answers is in tension with costs associated with interrupting numerous  candidate  answerers  per  question.  supporting  users  of  synchronous  social  q&a  systems  at  various  points  in  the  question lifecycle (from conception to answer) helps askers make informed decisions about the likelihood of question success and helps ans-werers  face  fewer  interruptions.  for  example,  predicting  that  a question will not be well answered may lead the asker to rephrase or retract the question. similarly, predicting that an answer is not forthcoming during the dialog can prompt system behaviors such as  finding  other  answerers  to  join  the  conversation.  as  another example, predictions of asker satisfaction can be assigned to completed conversations and used for later retrieval. in this paper, we use data from an instant-messaging-based synchronous social q&a service deployed to an online community of over two thousand users to study the prediction of (i) whether a question will be answered, (ii) the number of candidate answerers that the question will be sent to, and (iii) whether the asker will be satisfied  by  the  answer  received.  predictions  are  made  at  many points of the question lifecycle (e.g., when the question is entered, when the answerer is located, halfway through the asker-answerer dialog, etc.). the findings from our study show that we can learn capable  models  for  these  tasks  using  a  broad  range  of  features derived  from  user  profiles,  system  interactions,  question  setting, and the dialog between asker and answerer. our research can lead to more sophisticated and more useful real-time q&a support.
