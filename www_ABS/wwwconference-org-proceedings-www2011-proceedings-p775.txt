the  multimedia  information  retrieval  community  has  dedicated extensive  research  effort  to  the  problem  of  content-based  image retrieval (cbir). however, these systems find their main limitation in  the  difficulty  of  creating  pictorial  queries.  as  a  result,  few systems offer the option of querying by visual examples, and rely on  automatic  concept  detection  and  tagging  techniques to  provide support for searching visual content using textual queries. this paper proposes and studies a practical multimodal web search scenario, where cbir fits intuitively to improve the retrieval of rich information queries. many online articles contain useful know-how knowledge  about  computer  applications.  these  articles  tend  to  be richly illustrated by screenshots. we present a system to search for such  software  know-how  articles the  visual correspondences  between  screenshots.  users  can  naturally  create pictorial queries simply by taking a screenshot of the application to retrieve a list of articles containing a matching screenshot. we  build  a  prototype  comprising  150k  articles  that  are  classified into walkthrough, book, gallery, and general categories, and provide a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  this  system,  focusing  on  technical (accuracy  of  cbir  techniques)  and  usability  (perceived  system usefulness)  aspects.  we  also  consider  the  study  of  added  value features of such a visual-supported search, including the ability to perform  cross-lingual  queries.  we  find  that  the  system  is  able  to retrieve matching screenshots for a wide variety of programs, across language boundaries, and provide subjectively more useful results than keyword-based web and image search engines.
