in this paper, we propose a new similarity measure to compute the pairwise similarity of text-based documents based on su x tree document model. by applying the new suf- x tree similarity measure in group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering (gahc) algorithm, we developed a new su x tree document clustering algorithm (nstc). experimental results on two standard document clustering benchmark corpus ohsumed and rcv1 indicate that the new clustering algorithm is a very e ective document clustering algorithm. comparing with the results of traditional word term weight tf-idf similarity measure in the same gahc algorithm, nstc achieved an improvement of 51% on the average of f-measure score. furthermore, we apply the new clustering algorithm in analyzing the web documents in online forum communities. a topic oriented clustering algorithm is developed to help people in assessing, classifying and searching the the web documents in a large forum community.
