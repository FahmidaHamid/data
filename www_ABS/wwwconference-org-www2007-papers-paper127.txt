this  paper  is  based  on  our  exploratory  study  of  a  south  indian village in chamrajanagar district of karnataka. the study was to understand  the  rural  communication  environment  and  villagers  communication  preferences.  we  examined  people s  lifestyle, working  conditions  and  their  communication  ecosystem.  our study revealed that villagers, unlike urban inhabitants, interacted with  people  outside  the  village  only  for  specific,  rather  than casual rural communication was the marginal use of the postal system and the ubiquitous use of pay phone, apart from word of mouth and face-to-face  interactions.  in  fact,  personal  (face-to-face)  interaction was  usually  preferred  among  villages  in  this  region,  over  other kinds  of  communication,  despite  infrastructural  constraints  like poor transport services. we also observed that communication frequency increased when status  quo  changed  to  one  that  required  immediate  attention. during  the  analysis  we  identified  certain  social,  economic  and cultural  communication  gaps  (or  problems).  however,  these problems  were  clear  opportunities  to  connect  the  unconnected rural  users,  by  deploying  new  communication  systems  and features.  here,  we  have  highlighted  some  of  our  findings  and possible design avenues based on these findings.
