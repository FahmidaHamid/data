peer-to-peer technologies are increasingly becoming the medium of choice for delivering media content, both professional and homegrown, to large user populations. indeed, current p2p swarming systems have been shown to be very ef cient for large-scale content distribution with few server resources. however, such systems have been designed for generic  le distribution and provide a limited user experience for viewing media content. for example, users need to wait to download the full video before they can start watching it. in general, the main challenge resides in designing systems that ensure that users can start watching a movie at any point in time, with small startup times and sustainable playback rates. in this work, we address the issues of providing a video-on-demand (vod) using p2p mesh-based networks. we show that providing high quality vod using p2p is feasible using a combination of techniques including (a) network coding, (b) optimized resource allocation across different parts of the video, and (c) overlay topology management algorithms. our evaluation also shows that systems that do not optimize in all these dimensions could significantly under-utilize the network resources resulting in poor vod performance. we present our results based on simulations and a prototype implementation.
