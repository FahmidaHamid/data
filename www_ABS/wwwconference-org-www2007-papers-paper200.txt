with the growth of interest on the web services, people pay increasingly attention to the choreography, that is, to describe collaborations of participants in accomplishing a common business goal from a global viewpoint. in this paper, based on a simple choreography language and a role-oriented process language, we study some fundamental issues related to choreography, especially those related to implementation, including semantics, projection and natural projection, dominant role in choices and iterations, etc. we propose the concept of dominant role and some novel languages structures related to it. the study reveals some clues about the language, the semantics, the speci cation and the implementation of choreography.
