near-duplicate web documents are abundant. two such documents di(cid11)er from each other in a very small portion that displays advertisements, for example. such di(cid11)erences are irrelevant for web search. so the quality of a web crawler increases if it can assess whether a newly crawled web page is a near-duplicate of a previously crawled web page or not. in the course of developing a near-duplicate detection system for a multi-billion page repository, we make two research contributions. first, we demonstrate that charikar s (cid12)nger-printing technique is appropriate for this goal. second, we present an algorithmic technique for identifying existing f bit (cid12)ngerprints that di(cid11)er from a given (cid12)ngerprint in at most k bit-positions, for small k. our technique is useful for both online queries (single (cid12)ngerprints) and batch queries (multiple (cid12)ngerprints). experimental evaluation over real data con(cid12)rms the practicality of our design.
