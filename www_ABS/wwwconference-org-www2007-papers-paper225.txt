weblogs  have  become  a  prevalent  source  of  information  for people to express themselves. in general, there are two genres of contents  in  weblogs.  the  first  kind  is  about  the  webloggers  personal  feelings,  thoughts  or  emotions.    we  call  this  kind  of weblogs  affective  articles.  the  second  kind  of  weblogs  is  about technologies and different kinds of informative news. in this paper, we present a machine learning method for classifying informative and  affective  articles  among  weblogs.  we  consider  this  problem as  a  binary  classification  problem.  by  using  machine  learning approaches,  we  achieve  about  92%  on  information  retrieval performance measures including precision, recall and f1. we set up  three  studies  on  the  applications  of  above  classification approach  in  both  research  and  industrial  fields.  the  above classification  approach  is  used  to  improve  the  performance  of classification of emotions from weblog articles.  we also develop an intent-driven weblog-search engine based on the classification techniques to improve the satisfaction of web users. finally, our approach  is  applied  to  search  for  weblogs  with  a  great  deal  of informative articles.
