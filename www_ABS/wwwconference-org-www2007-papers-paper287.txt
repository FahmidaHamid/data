in this paper we present an application framework that leverages geospatial  content  on  the  world  wide  web  by  enabling innovative modes of interaction and novel types of user interfaces on  advanced  mobile  phones  and  pdas.  we  discuss  the  current development  steps  involved  in  building  mobile  geospatial  web applications and derive three technological prerequisites for our framework spatial query operations based on visibility and field of  view,  a  2.5d  environment  model,  and  a  presentation-independent  data  exchange  format  for  geospatial  query  results. we propose the local visibility model as a suitable xml-based candidate and present a prototype implementation.
