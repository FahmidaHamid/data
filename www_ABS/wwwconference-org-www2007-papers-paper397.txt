this paper explores the use of social annotations to improve web search.  nowadays,  many  services,  e.g.  del.icio.us,  have  been developed for web users to organize and share their favorite web pages  on  line  by  using  social  annotations.  we  observe  that  the social annotations can benefit web search in two aspects 1) the annotations  are  usually  good  summaries  of  corresponding  web pages; 2) the count of annotations indicates the popularity of web pages.  two  novel  algorithms  are  proposed  to  incorporate  the above  information  into  page  ranking  1)  socialsimrank  (ssr) calculates  the  similarity  between  social  annotations  and  web queries; 2) socialpagerank (spr) captures the popularity of web pages.  preliminary  experimental  results  show  that  ssr  can  find the latent semantic association between queries and annotations, while spr successfully measures the quality (popularity) of a web page  from  the  web  users   perspective.  we  further  evaluate  the proposed  methods  empirically  with  50  manually  constructed queries  and  3000  auto-generated  queries  on  a  dataset  crawled from  del.icio.us.  experiments  show  that  both  ssr  and  spr benefit web search significantly.
