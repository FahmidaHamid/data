service-level agreements (slas) establish a contract between service providers and clients concerning quality of service (qos) parameters. without proper penalties, service providers have strong incentives to deviate from the advertised qos, causing losses to the clients. reliable qos monitoring (and proper penalties computed on the for the basis of delivered qos) are therefore essential trustworthiness of a service-oriented environment. in this paper, we present a novel qos monitoring mechanism based on quality ratings from the clients. a reputation mechanism collects the ratings and computes the actual quality delivered to the clients. the mechanism provides incentives for the clients to report honestly, and pays special attention to minimizing cost and overhead.1
