enterprise and web data processing and content aggregation systems often require extensive use of human-reviewed data (e.g. for training and monitoring machine learning-based applications). today these needs are often met by in-house e(cid11)orts or outsourced o(cid11)shore contracting. emerging applications attempt to provide automated collection of human-reviewed data at internet-scale. we conduct extensive experiments to study the e(cid11)ectiveness of one such application. we also study the feasibility of using yahoo! answers, a general question-answering forum, for human-reviewed data collection.
