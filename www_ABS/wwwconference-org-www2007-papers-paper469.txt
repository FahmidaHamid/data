a key challenge for dynamic web service selection is that web services are typically highly con gurable and service requesters often have dynamic preferences on service con gurations. current approaches, such as ws-agreement, describe web services by enumerating the various possible service con gurations, an ine cient approach when dealing with numerous service attributes with large value spaces. we model web service con gurations and associated prices and preferences more compactly using utility function policies, which also allows us to draw from multi-attribute decision theory methods to develop an algorithm for optimal service selection. in this paper, we present an owl ontology for the speci cation of con gurable web service o ers and requests, and a  exible and extensible framework for optimal service selection that combines declarative logic-based matching rules with optimization methods, such as linear programming. assuming additive price/preference functions, experimental results indicate that our algorithm introduces an overhead of only around 2 sec. compared to random service selection, while giving optimal results. the overhead, as percentage of total time, decreases as the number of o ers and con g-urations increase.
