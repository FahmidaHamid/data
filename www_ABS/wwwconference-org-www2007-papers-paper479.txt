the work(cid13)ow language martlet described in this paper implements a new programming model that allows users to write parallel programs and analyse distributed data without having to be aware of the details of the parallelisation. martlet abstracts the parallelisation of the computation and the splitting of the data through the inclusion of constructs inspired by functional programming. these allow programs to be written as an abstract description that can be adjusted automatically at runtime to match the data set and available resources. using this model it is possible to write programs to perform complex calculations across a distributed data set such as singular value decomposition or least squares problems, as well as creating an intuitive way of working with distributed systems having described and evaluated martlet against other functional languages for parallel computation, this paper goes on to look at how martlet might develop. in doing so it covers both possible additions to the language itself, and the use of jit compilers to increase the range of platforms it is capable of running on.
