although personalized search has been proposed for many years and many personalization strategies have been investigated, it is still unclear whether personalization is consistently e ective on di erent queries for di erent users, and under di erent search contexts. in this paper, we study this problem and provide some preliminary conclusions. we present a large-scale evaluation framework for personalized search based on query logs, and then evaluate  ve personalized search strategies (including two click-based and three pro le-based ones) using 12-day msn query logs. by analyzing the results, we reveal that personalized search has signi cant improvement over common web search on some queries but it has little e ect on other queries (e.g., queries with small click entropy). it even harms search accuracy under some situations. furthermore, we show that straightforward click-based personalization strategies perform consistently and considerably well, while pro le-based ones are unstable in our experiments. we also reveal that both long-term and short-term contexts are very important in improving search performance for pro le-based personalized search strategies.
