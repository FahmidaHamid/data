tra c classi cation is the ability to identify and categorize network tra c by application type. in this paper, we consider the problem of tra c classi cation in the network core. classi cation at the core is challenging because only partial information about the  ows and their contributors is available. we address this problem by developing a framework that can classify a  ow using only unidirectional  ow information. we evaluated this approach using recent packet traces that we collected and pre-classi ed to establish a  base truth . from our evaluation, we  nd that  ow statistics for the server-to-client direction of a tcp connection provide greater classi cation accuracy than the  ow statistics for the client-to-server direction. because collection of the server-to-client  ow statistics may not always be feasible, we developed and validated an algorithm that can estimate the missing statistics from a unidirectional packet trace.
