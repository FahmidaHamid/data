the  aggregation  and  comparison  of  behavioral  patterns  on  the www represent a tremendous opportunity for understanding past behaviors and predicting future behaviors.  in this paper, we take a first step at achieving this goal.  we present a large scale study correlating  the  behaviors  of  internet  users  on  multiple  systems ranging in size from 27 million queries to 14 million blog posts to 20,000 news articles.  we formalize a model for events in these time-varying  datasets  and  study  their  correlation.      we  have created an interface for analyzing the datasets, which includes a novel visual artifact, the dtwradar, for summarizing differences between  time  series.      using  our  tool  we  identify  a  number  of behavioral  properties  that  allow  us  to  understand  the  predictive power of patterns of use.
