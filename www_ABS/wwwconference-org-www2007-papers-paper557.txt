phishing is a significant problem involving fraudulent email  and web  sites  that  trick  unsuspecting  users  into  revealing  private information. in this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of cantina, a novel, content-based approach to detecting  phishing  web  sites,  based  on  the  tf-idf  information retrieval algorithm. we also discuss the design and evaluation of several  heuristics  we  developed  to  reduce  false  positives.  our experiments  show  that  cantina  is  good  at  detecting  phishing sites, correctly labeling approximately 95% of phishing sites.
