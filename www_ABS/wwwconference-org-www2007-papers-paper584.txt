in today s web, many functionality-wise similar web services are o(cid11)ered through heterogeneous interfaces (operation de(cid12)nitions) and business protocols (ordering constraints de-(cid12)ned on legal operation invocation sequences). the typical approach to enable interoperation in such a heterogeneous setting is through developing adapters. there have been approaches for classifying possible mismatches between service interfaces and business protocols to facilitate adapter development. however, the hard job is that of identifying, given two service speci(cid12)cations, the actual mismatches between their interfaces and business protocols. in this paper we present novel techniques and a tool that provides semi-automated support for identifying and resolution of mismatches between service interfaces and protocols, and for generating adapter speci(cid12)cation. we make the following main contributions (i) we identify mismatches between service interfaces, which leads to (cid12)nding mismatches of type of signature, merge/split, and extra/missing messages; (ii) we identify all ordering mismatches between service protocols and generate a tree, called mismatch tree, for mismatches that require developers  input for their resolution. in addition, we provide semi-automated support in analyzing the mismatch tree to help in resolving such mismatches. we have implemented the approach in a tool inside ibm wid (websphere integration developer). our experiments with some real-world case studies show the viability of the proposed approach. the methods and tool are sig-ni(cid12)cant in that they considerably simplify the problem of adapting services so that interoperation is possible.
