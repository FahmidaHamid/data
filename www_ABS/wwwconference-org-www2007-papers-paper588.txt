we develop a novel framework for the page-level template detection problem. our framework is built on two main ideas. the  rst is the automatic generation of training data for a classi er that, given a page, assigns a templateness score to every dom node of the page. the second is the global smoothing of these per-node classi er scores by solving a regularized isotonic regression problem; the latter follows from a simple yet powerful abstraction of templateness on a page. our extensive experiments on human-labeled test data show that our approach detects templates e ectively.
