we report the results of a large scale study of password use and password reuse habits. the study involved half a million users over a three month period. a client component on users  machines recorded a variety of password strength, usage and frequency metrics. this allows us to measure or estimate such quantities as the average number of passwords and average number of accounts each user has, how many passwords she types per day, how often passwords are shared among sites, and how often they are forgotten. we get extremely detailed data on password strength, the types and lengths of passwords chosen, and how they vary by site. the data is the  rst large scale study of its kind, and yields numerous other insights into the r ole the passwords play in users  online experience.
