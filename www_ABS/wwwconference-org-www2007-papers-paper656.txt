xacml has emerged as a popular access control language on the web, but because of its rich expressiveness, it has proved di cult to analyze in an automated fashion. in this paper, we present a formalization of xacml using description logics (dl), which are a decidable fragment of first-order logic. this formalization allows us to cover a more expressive subset of xacml than propositional logic-based analysis tools, and in addition we provide a new analysis service (policy redundancy). also, mapping xacml to description logics allows us to use o -the-shelf dl reasoners for analysis tasks such as policy comparison, veri cation and querying. we provide empirical evaluation of a policy analysis tool that was implemented on top of open source dl reasoner pellet.
