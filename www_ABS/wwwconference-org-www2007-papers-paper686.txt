demographic information plays an important role in personalized web  applications.  however,  it  is  usually  not  easy  to  obtain  this kind of personal data such as age and gender.  in  this  paper,  we made a first approach to predict users  gender and age from their the  webpage  view web  browsing  behaviors, information to  propagate demographic information between different users. there are three main  steps  in  our  approach  first,  learning  from  the  webpage click-though data, webpages are associated with users  (known) age and gender tendency through a discriminative model; second, users   (unknown)  age  and  gender  are  predicted  from  the demographic  information  of  the  associated  webpages  through  a bayesian  framework;  third,  based  on  the  fact  that  webpages visited  by  similar  users  may  be  associated  with  similar demographic  tendency,  and  users  with  similar  demographic information  would  visit  similar  webpages,  a  smoothing component is employed to overcome the data sparseness of web click-though log. experiments are conducted on a real web click-through  log  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed approach.  the  experimental  results  show  that  the  proposed algorithm  can  achieve  up  to  30.4%  improvements  on  gender prediction  and  50.3%  on  age  prediction  in  terms  of  macro  f1, compared to baseline algorithms.
