the  demand  of  browsing  information  from  general  web  pages using a mobile phone is increasing. however, since the majority of web pages on the internet are optimized for browsing from pcs, it  is  difficult  for  mobile  phone  users  to  obtain  sufficient information from the web. therefore, a method to reconstruct pc-optimized  web  pages  for  mobile  phone  users  is  essential.  an example  approach  is  to  segment  the  web  page  based  on  its structure,  and  utilize  the  hierarchy  of  the  content  element  to regenerate  a  page  suitable  for  mobile  phone  browsing.  in  our previous work, we have examined a robust automatic  web  page segmentation  scheme  which  uses  the  distance  between  content elements  based  on  the  relative  html  tag  hierarchy,  i.e.,  the number  and  depth  of  html  tags  in  web  pages.  however,  this scheme has a problem that the content-distance based on the order of  html  tags  does  not  always  correspond  to  the  intuitional distance between content elements on the actual layout of a web page. in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  hybrid  segmentation  method  which segments  web  pages  based  on  both the  content-distance calculated  by  the  previous  scheme,  and  a  novel  approach  which utilizes web page layout information.  experiments  conducted  to evaluate the accuracy of web page segmentation results prove that the  proposed  method  can  segment  web  pages  more  accurately than  conventional  methods.  furthermore,  implementation  and evaluation  of  our  system  on  the  mobile  phone  prove  that  our method  can  realize  superior  usability  compared  to  commercial web browsers.
