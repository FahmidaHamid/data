comparing  and  contrasting  is  an  important  strategy  people employ to understand new situations and create solutions for new problems.  similar  events  can  provide  hints  for  problem  solving, as  well  as larger  contexts  for  understanding  the  specific circumstances  of  an  event.  lessons  can  leaned  from  past experience, insights can be gained about the  new  situation  from familiar  examples,  and  trends  can  be  discovered  among  similar events. as the largest knowledge base for human beings, the web provides  both  an  opportunity  and  a  challenge  to  discover comparable  cases  in  order  to  facilitate  situation  analysis  and problem solving. in this paper, we present compare&contrast, a system that uses the web to discover comparable cases for news stories, documents about similar situations but involving distinct entities. the system analyzes a news story given by the user and builds  a  model  of  the  story.  with  the  story  model,  the  system dynamically  discovers  entities  comparable  to  the  main  entity  in the original story and uses these comparable entities as seeds to retrieve web pages about comparable cases. the system is domain independent,  does  not  require  any  domain-specific  knowledge engineering efforts, and deals with the complexity of unstructured text  and  noise  on  the  web  in  a  robust  way.  we  evaluated  the system with an experiment on a collection of news articles and a user study.
