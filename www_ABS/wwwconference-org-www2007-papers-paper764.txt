we  present  research  leading  toward  an  understanding  of  the optimal audiovisual representation for illustrating concepts for illiterate and semi-literate users of computers. in our user study, which to our knowledge is the first of its kind, we presented to 200  illiterate  subjects  each  of  13  different  health  symptoms  in one representation randomly selected among the following ten text, static drawings, static photographs, hand-drawn animations, and video, each with and without voice annotation. the goal was to see how comprehensible these representation types were for an  illiterate  audience.  we  used  a  methodology  for  generating each of the representations tested in a way that fairly stacks one representational type against the others. our main results are that (1) voice annotation generally helps in speed  of  comprehension,  but  bimodal  audiovisual  information can be confusing for the target population; (2) richer information is not necessarily better understood overall; (3) the relative value of  dynamic  imagery  versus  static  imagery  depends  on  various factors.  analysis  of  these  statistically  significant  results  and additional detailed results are also provided. acm classification keywords h.5.2 interfaces    input  devices  and  strategies, styles,  evaluation/methodology,  graphical  user (gui), user-centered design
