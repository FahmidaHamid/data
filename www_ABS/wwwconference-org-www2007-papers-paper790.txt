traditionally, information extraction from web tables has focused on small, more or less homogeneous corpora, often based on assumptions about the use of <table> tags. a multitude of di erent html implementations of web tables make these approaches di cult to scale. in this paper, we approach the problem of domain-independent information extraction from web tables by shifting our attention from the tree-based representation of web pages to a variation of the two-dimensional visual box model used by web browsers to display the information on the screen. the thereby obtained topological and style information allows us to  ll the gap created by missing domain-speci c knowledge about content and table templates. we believe that, in a future step, this approach can become the basis for a new way of large-scale knowledge acquisition from the current  visual web.
