combining data and code from third-party sources has enabled a new wave of web mashups that add creativity and functionality to web applications. however, browsers are poorly designed to pass data between domains, often forcing web developers to abandon security in the name of functionality. to address this de ciency, we developed subspace, a cross-domain communication mechanism that allows e -cient communication across domains without sacri cing security. our prototype requires only a small javascript library, and works across all major browsers. we believe subspace can serve as a new secure communication primitive for web mashups.
