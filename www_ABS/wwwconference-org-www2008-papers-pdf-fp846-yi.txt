in this paper we study the characteristics of search queries submitted from mobile devices using various yahoo! one-search applications during a 2 months period in the second half of 2007, and report the query patterns derived from 20 million english sample queries submitted by users in us, canada, europe, and asia. we examine the query distribution and topical categories the queries belong to in order to  nd new trends. we compare and contrast the search patterns between us vs international queries, and between queries from various search interfaces (xhtml/wap, java widgets, and sms). we also compare our results with previous studies wherever possible, either to con rm previous  ndings, or to  nd interesting di erences in the query distribution and pattern.
