automatic topic discovery and tracking on web-shared videos can greatly benefit both web service providers and end users. most of current  solutions  of  topic  detection  and  tracking  were  done  on news and cannot be directly applied on web videos, because the semantic  information  of  web  videos  is  much  less  than  that  of news videos. in this paper, we propose a bipartite graph model to address  this  issue.  the  bipartite  graph  represents  the  correlation between  web  videos  and  their  keywords,  and  automatic  topic discovery  is  achieved  through  two  steps     coarse  topic  filtering and  fine  topic  re-ranking.  first,  a  weight-updating  co-clustering algorithm  is  employed  to  filter  out  topic  candidates  at  a  coarse level. then the videos on each topic are re-ranked by analyzing the link structures of the corresponding bipartite graph. after the topics  are  discovered,  the  interesting  ones  can  also  be  tracked over a period of time using the same bipartite graph model. the key  is  to  propagate  the  relevant  scores  and  keywords  from  the videos  of  interests  to  other  relevant  ones  through  the  bipartite graph links. experimental results on real web videos from youku, a youtube counterpart in china, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. we report very promising results.
