in this paper, we formally de ne the problem of topic modeling with network structure (tmn). we propose a novel solution to this problem, which regularizes a statistical topic model with a harmonic regularizer based on a graph structure in the data. the proposed method combines topic modeling and social network analysis, and leverages the power of both statistical topic models and discrete regularization. the output of this model can summarize well topics in text, map a topic onto the network, and discover topical communities. with appropriate instantiations of the topic model and the graph-based regularizer, our model can be applied to a wide range of text mining problems such as author-topic analysis, community discovery, and spatial text mining. empirical experiments on two data sets with di erent genres show that our approach is e ective and outperforms both text-oriented methods and network-oriented methods alone. the proposed model is general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and an associated network structure.
