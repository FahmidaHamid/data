the web has become an important medium for news delivery and consumption. fresh content about a variety of topics and events is constantly  being  created  and  published  on  the  web  by  many sources.  as  intuitively  understood  by  readers,  and  studied  in journalism,  news  articles  produced  by  different  social  groups present different attitudes towards and interpretations of the same news  issues.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  new  paradigm  for aggregating news articles according to the news sources related to the stakeholders of the news issues. we implement this paradigm in  a  prototype  system  called  localsavvy.  the  system  provides users the capability to aggregate and browse various local views about the news issues in which they are interested.
