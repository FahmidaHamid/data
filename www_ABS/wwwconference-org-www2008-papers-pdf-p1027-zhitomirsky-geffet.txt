the  research  objective  of  this  work  is  to  develop  a  general framework  that  incorporates  collaborative  social  tagging  with  a novel  ontology  scheme  conveying  multiple  perspectives.  we propose a framework where multiple users tag the same object (an image in our case), and an ontology  is  extended  based  on  these tags while being tolerant about different points of view. we are not  aware  of  any  other  work  that  attempted  to  devise  such  an environment and to study its dynamics. the proposed framework characterizes the underlying processes for controlled collaborative development  of  a  multi-perspective  ontology  and  its  application to  improve  image  annotation,  searching  and  browsing.  our  case study experiment with a set of selected annotated images indicates the soundness of the proposed ontological model.
