all information exchange on the internet   whether through full text,  controlled  vocabularies,  ontologies,  or  other  mechanisms    ultimately  requires  that  that  an  information  provider  and  seeker use the same word or symbol. in this paper, we investigate what happens  when  both  searchers  and  authors  are  dynamically choosing terms to match the other side. with each side trying to anticipate  the  other,  does  a  terminological  convention  ever emerge, or do searchers and providers continue to miss potential partners  through  mismatch  of  terms?  we  use  a  game-theoretic setup to frame questions, and learning theory to make predictions about whether and which term will emerge as a convention.
