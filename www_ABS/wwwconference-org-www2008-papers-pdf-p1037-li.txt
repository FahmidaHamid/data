this paper proposes several vectorial operators for processing xml twig queries, which are easy to be performed and inherently e cient for both ancestor-descendant (ad) and parent-child (p-c) relationships. we develop optimizations on the vectorial operators to improve the e ciency of answering twig queries in holistic. we propose an algorithm to answer gtp queries based on our vectorial operators.
