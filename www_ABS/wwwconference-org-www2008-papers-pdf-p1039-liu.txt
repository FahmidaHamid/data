combating  web  spam  has  become  one  of  the  top  challenges  for web search engines. state-of-the-art spam detection techniques are usually  designed  for  specific  known  types  of  web  spam  and  are incapable  and  inefficient  for  recently-appeared  spam.  with  user behavior analyses into web access logs, we propose a spam page detection  algorithm  based  on  bayes learning.  preliminary experiments  on  web  access  data  collected  by  a  commercial  web site (containing over 2.74 billion user clicks in 2 months) show the effectiveness of the proposed detection framework and algorithm.
