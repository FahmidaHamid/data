in this paper, we study the problem of keyword proximity search over xml documents and leverage the e ciency and e ectiveness. we take the disjunctive semantics among input keywords into consideration and identify meaningful compact connected trees as the answers of keyword proximity queries. we introduce the notions of compact lowest common ancestor (clca) and maximal clca (mclca) and propose compact connected trees (cctrees) and maximal cctrees (mcctrees) to e ciently and e ectively answer keyword queries. we propose a novel ranking mechanism, race, to rank compact connected trees, by taking into consideration both the structural similarity and the textual similarity. our extensive experimental study shows that our method achieves both high search e ciency and e ec-tiveness, and outperforms existing approaches signi cantly.
