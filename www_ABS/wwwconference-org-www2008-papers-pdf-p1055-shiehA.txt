in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  collaborative  knowledge  semantic graphs image search (cksgis) system. it provides a novel way to  conduct  image  search  by  utilizing  the  collaborative  nature  in wikipedia and by performing network analysis to form semantic graphs for search-term expansion. the collaborative article editing process  used  by  wikipedia s  contributors  is  formalized  as bipartite  graphs  that  are  folded  into  networks  between  terms. when  a  user  types  in  a  search  term,  cksgis  automatically retrieves an interactive semantic graph of related terms that allow users to easily find related images not limited to a specific search term.  interactive  semantic  graph  then  serve  as  an  interface  to retrieve images through existing commercial search engines. this method  significantly  saves  users   time  by  avoiding  multiple search  keywords  that  are  usually  required  in  generic  search engines. it benefits both na ve users who do not possess a large vocabulary  and  professionals  who  look  for  images  on  a  regular basis.  in  our  experiments,  85%  of  the  participants  favored cksgis system rather than commercial search engines.
