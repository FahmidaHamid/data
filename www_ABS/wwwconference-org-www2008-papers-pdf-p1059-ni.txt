a lot of recent research has focused on the content-based dissemination of xml data. however, due to the heterogeneous data schemas used by di erent data publishers even for data in the same domain, an important challenge is how to e ciently and e ectively disseminate relevant data to subscribers whose subscriptions might be speci ed based on schemas that are di erent from those used by the data publishers. this paper examines the options to resolve this schema heterogeneity problem in xml data dissemination, and proposes a novel paradigm that is based on data rewriting. our experimental results demonstrate the e ectiveness of the data rewriting paradigm and identi es the tradeo s of the various approaches.
