this paper studies the problem of uni ed ranked retrieval of heterogeneous xml documents and web data. we propose an e ective search engine called sailer to adaptively and versatilely answer keyword queries over the heteroge-nous data. we model the web pages and xml documents as graphs. we propose the concept of pivotal trees to effectively answer keyword queries and present an e ective method to identify the top-k pivotal trees with the highest ranks from the graphs. moreover, we propose e ective indexes to facilitate the e ective uni ed ranked retrieval. we have conducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets, and the experimental results show that sailer achieves both high search e ciency and accuracy, and outperforms the existing approaches signi cantly.
