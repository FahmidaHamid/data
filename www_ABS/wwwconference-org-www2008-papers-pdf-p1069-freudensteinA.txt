complex dialogs with comprehensive underlying data models are gaining increasing importance in today s web applications. this in turn accelerates the need for highly  dynamic  dialogs  offering guidance  to  the  users  and  thus  reducing  cognitive  overload. beyond  that,  requirements  from  the  fields  of  aesthetics,  web accessibility, platform-independence, and web service integration arise.  to  this  end,  we  present  an  evolutionary,  extensible approach for the model-driven construction of advanced dialogs. it  is  based  on  a  domain-specific  language  (dsl)  focusing  on simplicity and fostering collaboration with stakeholders.
