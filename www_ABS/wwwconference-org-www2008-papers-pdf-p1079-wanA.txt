webpmi is a popular web-based association measure to evaluate the semantic similarity between two queries (i.e. words or entities) by leveraging search results returned by search engines. this paper proposes  a  novel  measure  named  cm-pmi  to  evaluate  query similarity  at  a  finer  granularity  than  webpmi,  under  the assumption that a query is usually associated with more than one aspect  and  two  queries  are  deemed  semantically  related  if  their associated  aspect  sets  are  highly  consistent  with  each  other. cm-pmi  first  extracts  contextual  labels  from  search  results  to represent  the  aspects  of  a  query,  and  then  uses  the  optimal matching method to assess the consistency between the aspects of two  queries.  experimental  results  on  the  benchmark  miller charles   dataset  demonstrate  the  good  effectiveness  of  the proposed cm-pmi measure. moreover, we further fuse webpmi and cm-pmi to obtain improved results.
