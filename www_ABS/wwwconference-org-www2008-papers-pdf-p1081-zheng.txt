it is a kind of privacy infraction in personalized web service if the user profile submitted to one web site transferred to another site without  user  permission.  that  can  cause  the  second  web  site easily re-identify to whom these personal data belong, no matter whether the transfer is under control or by hacking. this  paper  presents  a  portable  solution  for  users  to  bind  their sensitive  web  data  under  the  appointed  domain.  such  data, including  query  logs,  user  accounts,  click  stream  etc,  could  be used  to  identify  the  sensitive  information  of  the  particular  user. by  our  domain  stretching  de-identification  method,  if  personal data  leak  from  domain  a  to  b,  the  web  user  could  still  not  be identified even though he logins to sites under domain b using the same  name  and  password.  in  the  experiment  implemented  by javascript,  we  show  the  flexibility  and  efficiency  of  our  de-identification approach.
