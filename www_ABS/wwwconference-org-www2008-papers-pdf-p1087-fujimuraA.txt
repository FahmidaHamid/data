this paper proposes a new method for displaying large-scale tag clouds. we use a topographical image that helps users to grasp the relationship  among  tags  intuitively  as  a  background  to  the  tag clouds. we apply this interface  to  a  blog  navigation  system  and show that the proposed method enables users to find the desired tags easily even if the tag clouds are very large, 5,000 and above tags. our approach is also effective for understanding the overall structure of a large amount of tagged documents.
