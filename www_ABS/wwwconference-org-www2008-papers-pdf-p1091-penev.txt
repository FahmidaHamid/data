social tagging describes a community of users labeling web content with tags. it is a simple activity that enriches our knowledge about resources on the web. for a computer to help users search the tagged repository, it must know when tags are good or bad. we describe tagscore, a scoring function that rates the goodness of tags. the tags and their ratings give us a succinct synopsis for a page. we  nd similar  pages in del.icio.us by comparing synopses. our approach gives good correlation to the full cosine similarity but is hundreds of times faster.
