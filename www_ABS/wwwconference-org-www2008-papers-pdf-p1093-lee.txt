in this paper, targeting del.icio.us tag data, we propose a method, folksoviz,  for  deriving  subsumption  relationships  between  tags by using wikipedia texts, and visualizing a folksonomy. to fulfill this method, we propose a statistical model for deriving subsump-tion relationships based on the frequency of each tag on the wiki-pedia texts, as well as the tsd (tag sense disambiguation) method for mapping each tag to a corresponding wikipedia text. the derived  subsumption  pairs  are  visualized  effectively  on  the screen. the experiment shows that the folksoviz manages to find the correct subsumption pairs with high accuracy.
