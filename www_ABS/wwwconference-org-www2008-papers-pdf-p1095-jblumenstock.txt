wikipedia,  the free encyclopedia , now contains over two million english articles, and is widely regarded as a high-quality, authoritative encyclopedia. some wikipedia articles, however, are of questionable quality, and it is not always apparent to the visitor which articles are good and which are bad. we propose a simple metric   word count   for measuring article quality. in spite of its striking simplicity, we show that this metric signi cantly outperforms the more complex methods described in related work.
