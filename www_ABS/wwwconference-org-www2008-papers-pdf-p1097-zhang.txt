in this paper we measured and analyzed the workload on yahoo! video, the 2nd largest u.s. video sharing site, to understand its nature and the impact on online video data center design. we discovered interesting statistical properties on both static and temporal dimensions of the workload including  le duration and popularity distributions, arrival rate dynamics and predictability, and workload stationar-ity and burstiness. complemented with queueing-theoretic techniques, we further extended our understanding on the measurement data with a virtual design on the workload and capacity management components of a data center assuming the same workload as measured, which reveals key results regarding the impact of service level agreements (slas) and workload scheduling schemes on the design and operations of such large-scale video distribution systems.
