we propose a novel approach to  nd aliases of a given name from the web. we exploit a set of known names and their aliases as training data and extract lexical patterns that convey information related to aliases of names from text snippets returned by a web search engine. the patterns are then used to  nd candidate aliases of a given name. we use anchor texts and hyperlinks to design a word co-occurrence model and de ne numerous ranking scores to evaluate the association between a name and its candidate aliases. the proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and previous work on alias extraction on a dataset of personal names, achieving a statistically signi cant mean reciprocal rank of 0.6718. moreover, the aliases extracted using the proposed method improve recall by 20% in a relation-detection task.
