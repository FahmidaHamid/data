we  developed  the  hs-bitmap  index  for  efficient  information retrieval.  the  hs-bitmap  index  is  a  hierarchical  document-term matrix the original document-term matrix is called the leaf matrix and  an  upper  matrix  is  the  summary  of  its  lower  matrix.  our experiment  results  show  the  hs-bitmap  index  performs  better than the inverted index with a minor space overhead.
