most of the search engine optimization techniques attempt to predict users interest by learning from the past information collected from di erent sources. but, a user s current interest often depends on many factors which are not captured in the past information. in this paper, we attempt to identify user s current interest in real time from the information provided by the user in the current query session. by identifying user s interest in real time, the engine could adapt di erently to di erent users in real time. experimental veri cation indicates that our approach is encouraging for short queries.
