web spam detection has become one of the top challenges for the internet search industry. instead of using some heuristic rules, we propose a feature re-extraction strategy to optimize the detection result.  based  on  the  predicted  spamicity  obtained  by  the preliminary  detection,  through  the  host  level  web  graph,  three types  of  features  are  extracted.  experiments  on  webspam-uk2006 benchmark show that with this strategy, the performance of web spam detection can be improved evidently.
