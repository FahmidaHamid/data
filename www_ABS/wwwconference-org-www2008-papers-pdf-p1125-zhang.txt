this paper presents a new method of calculating the sematic similarity between articles based on wordnet. to further improve the performance of the proposed method, we build a new compact concept ontology (cco) from wordnet by combining the words with similar sematic meanings. the experimental results show that our approach signi cantly outperforms a recent proposal of computing semantic similarity, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cco method.
