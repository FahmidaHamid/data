(1) similar to memory, human interests wane as time goes by (2) forgetting  speed  slows  down  gradually  and  the  accumulated blogs have been expanded at an incredible speed in recent years. interests become more stable. based on the two principles above, plentiful personal information makes blogs a popular way mining we  construct  two  interest  models  for  different  purposes.  stim user profiles. in this paper, we propose a novel bloggers  interests bloggers  recent interests with weak stability; ltim accumulated modeling  approach  based  on  forgetting  mechanism.  a  new interest status after a long period with strong stability. forgetting  function  is  introduced  to  track  interest  drift.  based  on that,  the  short  term  interest  models  (stim)  and  long  term 2.  main approach interest  models  (ltim)  are  constructed  to  describe  bloggers  2.1  model representation short-term  and  long-term  interests.  the  experiments  show  that both models can identify bloggers  preferences well respectively. in  our  approach,  interest  models  are  represented  by  vectors  v= {(c1,  w1,  tj),  (c2,  w2,  tj), ,(cm,  wm,  tj)}.  we  predefine  m  interest categories {c1, c2, c,,...,cm} and each category ci is associated with a  weight  wi  according  to  its  cohesion  with  users   interests.  the term tj denotes the timestamp when the model is constructed. post  vectors  are  the  foundation  of  our  blogger  modeling  work. each category ci in the vector is assigned with a weight wi which denotes the probability this post belongs to ci. the probability is given  through  the  process  of  text  classification  (we  use  naive bayes classification model in our work). 2.2  interest forgetting function as  an  important  part  of  our  approach,  the  forgetting  function  is implemented  to  simulate  the  attenuation  of  users   interests  as shown in the following equation t est ln 2 (     hl
