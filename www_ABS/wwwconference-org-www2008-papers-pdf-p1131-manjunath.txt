supporting fast access to large rdf stores has been  one  of  key challenges  for  enabling  use  of  the  semantic  web  in  real-life applications,  more  so  in  sensor-based  systems  where  large amounts  of  historic  data  needs  to  be  stored.  we  propose  a semantics-based  temporal  view  mechanism  that  enables  faster access  to  time-varying  data  by  caching  into  memory  only  the required  subset  of  rdf  triples.  we  describe  our  experience  of implementing  such  a  framework  in  the  context  of  a  wide  area network monitoring system. our preliminary results show that our solution significantly improves client access time and scales well for moderate data sets.
