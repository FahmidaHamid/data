the shape of the web in terms of its graphical structure has been a widely interested topic. two graphs, bow tie and daisy, have stood out from previous research. in this work, we take a different approach,  by  viewing  the  web  as  a  hierarchy  of  three  levels, namely page level, host level, and domain level. such structures are  analyzed  and  compared  with  a  snapshot  of  chinese  web  in early 2006, involving 830 million pages, 17 million hosts, and 0.8 million  domains.  some  interesting  results  have  emerged.  for example,  the  chinese  web  appears  more  like  a  teapot  (with  a large size of scc, a medium size of in and a small size of out) at  page  level  than  the  classic  bow  tie  or  daisy  shape.  some challenging phenomena are also observed. for example, the ins become  much  smaller  than  outs  at  host  and  domain  levels. future work will tackle these puzzles.
