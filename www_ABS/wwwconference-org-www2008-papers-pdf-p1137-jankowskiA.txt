the world wide web allows users to create and publish a variety the of contemporary  best  practices  for  designing  web interfaces, however, do not take into account the 3d techniques. in  this  paper  we  present  a  novel  approach  for  designing interactive web applications   2-layer interface paradigm (2lip). the  background  layer  of  the  2lip-type  user  interface  is  a  3d scene, which a user cannot directly interact with. the foreground layer is html content. only taking an action on this content (e.g. pressing a hyperlink, scrolling a page) can affect the 3d scene. we introduce a reference implementation of 2lip copernicus   the virtual 3d encyclopedia, which shows one of the potential paths of the evolution of wikipedia towards web 3.0. based on the  evaluation  of  copernicus  we  prove  that  designing  web interfaces  according  to  2lip  provides  users  a  better  browsing experience, without harming the interaction. we  worked  out  a  new  way  for  designing  interactive  3d  web applications - 2-layer interface paradigm (2lip). 2.  2lip some  web  designers  dream  about  building  interfaces  that approach the richness of three-dimensional reality. they believe that the closer the interfaces are to the real world, the easier it will be  to  use  them.  nevertheless,  user  studies  proved  that  complex and  disorienting  navigation  and  annoying  occlusions  can  slow performance in 3d interfaces [2,3].
