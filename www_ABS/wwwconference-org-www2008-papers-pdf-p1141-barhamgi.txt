in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  new  approach  to  automatically compose  data  providing  web  services.  our  approach  exploits existing  mature  works  done integration  systems. specifically,  data  providing  services  are  modeled  as  rdf parameterized  views  over  mediated  ontologies.  then,  an  rdf oriented algorithm to compose services based on query rewriting techniques was devised. we apply also an optimization algorithm on  the  generated  composition  to  speed  up  its  execution.  the results of our experiments show that the algorithms scale up very well up to a large number of services, covering thus most realistic applications.
