this work aims to provide a novel, site-speci(cid12)c web page segmentation and section importance detection algorithm, which leverages structural, content, and visual information. the structural and content information is leveraged via template, a generalized regular expression learnt over set of pages. the template along with visual information results into high sectioning accuracy. the experimental results demonstrate the e(cid11)ectiveness of the approach.
