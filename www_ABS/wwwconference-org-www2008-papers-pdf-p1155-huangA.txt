in this paper, we describe an experimental search engine on our chinese  web  archive  since  2001.  the  original  data  set  contains nearly  3  billion  chinese  web  pages  crawled  from  past  5  years. from the collection, 430 million  article-like  pages are selected and  then  partitioned  into  68  million  sets  of  similar  pages.    the titles and publication dates are determined for the pages. an index is  built.  when  searching,  the  system  returns  related  pages  in  a chronological  order.  this  way,  if  a  user  is  interested  in  news reports  or  commentaries  for  certain  previously  happened  event, he/she will be able to find a quite rich set of highly related pages in a convenient way.
