query result caching is an important mechanism for search engine efficiency.  in  this  study,  we  first  review  several  query  features that  are  used  to  determine  the  contents  of  a  static  result  cache. next, we introduce a new feature that more accurately represents the  popularity  of  a  query  by  measuring  the  stability  of  query frequency over a set of time intervals. experimental results show that  this  new  feature  achieves  hit  ratios  better  than  those  of  the previously proposed features.
