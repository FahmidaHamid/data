we model budget-constrained keyword bidding in sponsored search auctions as a stochastic multiple-choice knapsack problem (s-mckp) and design an algorithm to solve s-mckp and the corresponding bidding optimization problem. our algorithm selects items online based on a threshold function which can be built/updated using historical data. our algorithm achieved about 99% performance compared to the of ine optimum when applied to a real bidding dataset. with synthetic dataset and iid item-sets, its performance ratio against the o ine optimum converges to one empirically with increasing number of periods.
