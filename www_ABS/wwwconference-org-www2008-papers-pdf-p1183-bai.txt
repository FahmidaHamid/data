proximity of query terms in a document is an important criterion in ir. however, no investigation has been made to determine the most  useful  term  sequences  for  which  proximity  should  be considered.  in  this  study,  we  test  the  effectiveness  of  using proximity  of  partial  term  sequences  (n-grams)  for  web  search. we  observe  that  the  proximity  of  sequences  of  3  to  5  terms  is most effective for long queries, while shorter or longer sequences appear less useful. this suggests that combinations of 3 to 5 terms can best capture the intention in user queries. in addition, we also experiment with weighing the importance of query sub-sequences using  query tests  show promising empirical results. log  frequencies.  our  preliminary
