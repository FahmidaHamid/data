currently most link-related applications treat all links in the same web  page  to  be  identical.  one  link-related  application  usually requires  one  certain  property  of  hyperlinks  but  actually  not  all links  have  this  property  or  they  have  this  property  on  different levels. based on a study of how human users judge the links, the idea of the link function classification (lfc) is introduced in this paper. the link functions reflect the purpose that links are created by  web  page  designers  and  the  way  they  are  used  by  viewers. links  in  a  certain  function  class  imply  one  certain  relationship between the adjacent pages, and thus they can be assumed to have similar  properties.  an  algorithm  is  proposed  to  analyze  the  link functions based on both vision and structure features which simulates the reaction on the links of human users. current applications can  be  enhanced  by  lfc  with  a  more  accurate  modeling  of  the web graph. new mining methods can be also developed by making more and stronger assumptions on links within each function class due to the purer property set they share.
