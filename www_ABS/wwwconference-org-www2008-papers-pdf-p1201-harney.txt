this paper introduces a novel method for composing web services in the presence of external volatile information. our approach, which we call the informed-presumptive, is compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches for web service composition in volatile environments. we show empirically that the informed-presumptive strategy produces compositions in signi cantly less time than the other strategies with lesser backtracks.
