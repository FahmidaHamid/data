generally, web services are provided with different qos values, so  they  can  be  selected  dynamically  in  service  composition process. however, the conventional context free composition qos model does not consider the changeability of qos values and the context  sensitive  constraints  during  composition  process.  in  this paper,  we  propose  a  rule  based  context  sensitive  qos  model  to support the changeability of qos values and the context sensitive constraints.  by  considering  context  in  the  qos  model,  web service  composition  can  be  used  widely  and  flexibly  in  the  real world business.
