this  paper  proposes  a  general  framework  of  for  a  system  with  a semantic  browsing  and  visualization  interface  called  knowledge communication,  collaboration  and  creation  browser  (kc3 browser) integrates multimedia contests and web services on the grid  networks,  and  makes  a  semantic  mashup  called  knowledge workspace  (k-workspace)  with  various  visual  gadgets  according to user s contexts (e.g. their interests, purpose and computational environments).  kc3 browser also achieves  a  link-free  browsing for  seamless  knowledge  access  by  generating  semantic  links based  on  an  arbitrary  knowledge  models  such  as  ontology  and vector  space  models.    it  assists  users  to  look  down  and  to  figure out  various  social  and  natural  events  from  the  web  contents.  we have implemented a prototype of kc3 browser and tested it to an international project on risk intelligence against natural disaster.
