hypothesis generation is a crucial initial step for making scientific discoveries.  this  paper  addresses  the  problem  of  automatically discovering interesting hypotheses from the web. given a query containing  one  or interest,  our  algorithm automatically  generates  a  semantic  profile  describing the specified entity or provides the potential connections between two entities  of  interest.  we  implemented  a  prototype  on  top  of  the google  search  engine  and  the  experimental  results  demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. two  entities  of
