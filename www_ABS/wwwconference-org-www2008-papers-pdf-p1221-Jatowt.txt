recently,  along  with the preservation efforts have also increased. as a consequence,  large amounts  of  past  web  data  are  stored  in  web  archives.  this historical data can be used for better understanding of long-term page  topics  and  characteristics.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  an interactive visualization system called page history explorer for exploring  page  histories.  it  allows  for  roughly  portraying evolution of pages and summarizing their content over time. we use a temporal term cloud as a structure for visualizing prevailing and active terms appearing on pages in the past.
