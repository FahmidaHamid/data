ontology  mapping  seeks  to  find  semantic  correspondences between  similar  elements  of  different  ontologies.  this  paper proposes a neural network based approach to search for a global optimal  solution that  best  satisfies  ontology  constraints. experiments  on  oaei  benchmark  tests  show  it  dramatically improves the performance of preliminary mapping results.
