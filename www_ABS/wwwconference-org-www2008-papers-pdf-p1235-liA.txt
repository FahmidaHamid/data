with  the  rapid  growth  of  wireless  technologies  and  mobile devices, there is a great demand for personalized services in m-commerce.  collaborative  filtering  (cf)  is  one  of  successful techniques for users.   this  paper  proposes  a  novel  approach  to  improve  cf algorithms,  where  the  contextual  information  of  a  user  and  the multicriteria ratings of an item are considered besides the typical information  on  users  and  items.  the  multilinear  singular  value decomposition  (msvd)  technique  is  utilized  to  explore  both explicit  relations  and  implicit  relations  among  user,  item  and criterion. we implement the approach in an existing m-commerce platform,  and  encouraging  experimental  results  demonstrate  its effectiveness. recommendations
