a bipartite query-url graph, where an edge indicates that a document was clicked for a query, is a useful construct for  nding groups of related queries and urls. here we use this behavior graph for classi cation. we choose a click graph sampled from two weeks of image search activity, and the task of  adult   ltering identifying content in the graph that is inappropriate for minors. we show how to perform classi cation using random walks on this graph, and two methods for estimating classi er parameters.
