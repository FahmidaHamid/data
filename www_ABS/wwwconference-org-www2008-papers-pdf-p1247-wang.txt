most template detection methods process web pages in batches that a newly crawled page can not be processed until enough pages have been collected. this results in large storage consumption and a huge delay of data refreshing. in this paper, we present an incremental framework to detect templates in which a page is processed as soon as it has been crawled. in this framework, we don t need to cache any web page. experiments show that our framework consumes less than 7% storage than traditional methods. and also the speed of data refreshing is accelerated because of the incremental manner.
