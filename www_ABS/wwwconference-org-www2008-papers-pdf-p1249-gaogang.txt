rogue access points (raps) pose serious security threats to local networks.  an  analytic  model  of  prior  probability  distribution  of segmental  tcp  jitter  (stj)  is  deduced  from  the  mechanism  of ieee 802.11 mac distributed coordinated function (dcf) and used  to  differentiate  the  types  of  wire  and  wlan  connections which is the crucial step for raps detecting. stj as the detecting metric  can  reflect  more  the  characteristic  of  802.11  mac  than ack-pair  since  it  can  eliminate  the  delay  caused  by  packet transmission. the experiment on an operated network shows  the average  detection  ratio  of  the  algorithm  with  stj  is  more  than 92.8%  and  the  average  detection  time  is  less  than  1s  with improvement  of  20%  and  60%  over  the  detecting  approach  of ack-pair respectively. farther more no wlan training trace is needed in the detecting algorithm.
