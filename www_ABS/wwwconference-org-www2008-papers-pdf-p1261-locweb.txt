the world wide web has become the world s largest networked information  resource,  but  references  to  geographical  locations remain unstructured and typically implicit in nature. this lack of explicit  spatial  knowledge  within  the  web  makes  it  difficult  to service  user  needs  for  location-specific  information.  at  present, spatial knowledge is hidden in many small information fragments such as addresses on web pages, annotated photos with gps coordinates, geographic mapping applications, and geotags in user-generated  content.  several  emerging  formats  that  primarily  or secondarily  include  location  metadata,  like  georss,  kml,  and microformats, aim to improve this state of affairs. however, the question remains how to extract, index, mine, find, view, mashup, and exploit web content using its location semantics. this workshop brings together researchers from academia and industry labs to discuss and present the latest results and trends in all facets of the relationships between location concepts and web information. categories & subject descriptors h. information systems, h.3.1 [information storage and retrieval] content analysis and indexing, h.3.3 [information storage and retrieval] information search and retrieval, h.3.5 [information storage and retrieval] online information services, h.5.4 [information interfaces and presentation] hypertext/hypermedia.
