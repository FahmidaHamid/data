the web is increasingly understood as a global information space consisting  not  just  of  linked  documents,  but  also  of  linked  data. more than just a vision, the resulting web of data has been brought into being by the maturing of the semantic web technology stack, and  by  the  publication  of  an  increasing  number  of  datasets according to the principles of linked data. the  linked  data  on  the  web  (ldow2008)  workshop  brings together  researchers  and  practitioners  working  on  all  aspects  of linked data. the workshop  provides a forum to present the state of the  art  in  the  field  and  to  discuss  ongoing  and  future  research challenges. in this workshop summary we will outline the technical context in which linked data is situated, describe developments in the  past  year  through  initiatives  such  as  the  linking  open  data community project, and look ahead to the workshop itself.
