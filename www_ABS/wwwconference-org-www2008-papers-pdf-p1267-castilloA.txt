adversarial ir in general, and search engine spam, in particular, are engaging research topics with a real-world impact for web users, advertisers and publishers. the airweb workshop will bring researchers and practitioners in these areas together, to present and discuss state-of-the-art techniques as well as real-world experiences. given the continued growth in search engine spam creation and detection e orts, we expect interest in this airweb to surpass that of the previous three editions of the workshop (held jointly with www 2005, sigir 2006, and www 2007 respectively).
