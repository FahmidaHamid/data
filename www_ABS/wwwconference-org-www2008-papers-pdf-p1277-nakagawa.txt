the  amount  of  information  available  on  the  web  has  increased rapidly,  reaching  levels  that  few  would  ever  have  imagined possible.  we  live  in  what  could  be  called  the  "information-explosion  era,"  and  this  situation  poses  new  problems  for computer scientists. users demand useful and reliable information from the web in  the  shortest  time  possible,  but  the  obstacles  to fulfilling  this  demand  are  many  including  language  barriers  and the  so-called  "long  tail."  even  worse,  users  may  provide  only vague specifications of the information that they actually want, so that a more concrete specification must somehow be inferred by web  access  tools.  natural  language  processing  (nlp)  is  one  of the  key  technologies  for  solving  the  above  web  usability problems.  almost  all  the  web  page  provide  with  the  essential information in the form of natural language texts, and the amount of  these  text  information  is  huge.  in  order  to  offer  solutions  to these  problems  we  must  perform  searching  and  extracting information from the web texts using nlp technologies. the aim of  this  workshop  nlp  challenges  in  the  information explosion  era  (nlpix  2008)  is  to  bring  researchers  and practitioners together in order to discuss our most pressing needs with respect to accessing information on the web, and to discuss new ideas in nlp technologies that might offer viable solutions for those issues.
