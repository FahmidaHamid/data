with the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multiple data sources, a challenging issue is to  nd near duplicate records e ciently. in this paper, we focus on e cient algorithms to  nd pairs of records such that their similarities are above a given threshold. several existing algorithms rely on the pre x  ltering principle to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records. we propose new  ltering techniques by exploiting the ordering information; they are integrated into the existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve the e ciency. experimental results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve up to 2.6x 5x speedup over previous algorithms on several real datasets and provide alternative solutions to the near duplicate web page detection problem.
