we study the cost-per-action or cost-per-acquisition (cpa) charging scheme in online advertising. in this scheme, instead of paying per click, the advertisers pay only when a user takes a speci c action (e.g.  lls out a form) or completes a transaction on their websites. we focus on designing e cient and incentive compatible mechanisms that use this charging scheme. we describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational, asymptotically bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante e cient. in particular, we demonstrate our mechanism for the case where the utility functions of the advertisers are independent and identically-distributed random variables as well as the case where they evolve like independent re ected brownian motions.
