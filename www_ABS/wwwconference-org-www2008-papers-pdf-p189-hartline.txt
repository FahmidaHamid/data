we discuss the use of social networks in implementing viral marketing strategies. while in uence maximization has been studied in this context (see chapter 24 of [10]), we study revenue maximization, arguably, a more natural objective. in our model, a buyer s decision to buy an item is in uenced by the set of other buyers that own the item and the price at which the item is o ered. we focus on algorithmic question of  nding revenue maximizing marketing strategies. when the buyers are completely symmetric, we can  nd the optimal marketing strategy in polynomial time. in the general case, motivated by hardness results, we investigate approximation algorithms for this problem. we identify a family of strategies called in uence-and-exploit strategies that are based on the following idea initially in uence the population by giving the item for free to carefully a chosen set of buyers. then extract revenue from the remaining buyers using a  greedy  pricing strategy. we  rst argue why such strategies are reasonable and then show how to use recently developed set-function maximization techniques to  nd the right set of buyers to in uence.
