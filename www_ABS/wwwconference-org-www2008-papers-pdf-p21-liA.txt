current web search engines return result pages containing mostly text  summary  even  though  the  matched  web  pages  may  contain informative  pictures.  a  text  excerpt  (i.e.  snippet)  is  generated  by selecting  keywords  around  the  matched  query  terms  for  each returned  page  to  provide  context  for  user s  relevance  judgment. however,  in  many  scenarios,  we  found  that  the  pictures  in  web pages, if selected properly, could be added into search result pages and  provide  richer  contextual  description  because  a  picture  is worth  a  thousand  words.  such  new  summary  is  named  as  image excerpts.  by  well  designed  user  study,  we  demonstrate  image excerpts can help users make much quicker relevance judgment of search results for a wide range of query types. to implement this idea, we propose a practicable approach to automatically generate image  excerpts  in  the  result  pages  by  considering  the  dominance of each picture in each web page and the relevance of the picture to  the  query.  we  also  outline  an  efficient  way  to  incorporate image  excerpts  in  web  search  engines.  web  search  engines  can adopt our approach by slightly modifying their index and inserting a few low cost operations in their workflow. our experiments on a large  web  dataset  indicate  the  performance  of  the  proposed approach is very promising.
