geographic information  has  spawned  many  novel  web applications  where  global  positioning  system  (gps)  plays important  roles  in  bridging  the  applications  and  end  users. learning  knowledge  from  users   raw  gps  data  can  provide  rich context information for  both geographic and mobile applications. however,  so  far,  raw  gps  data  are  still  used  directly  without much  understanding.  in  this  paper,  an  approach  based  on supervised infer transportation mode from raw gps data. the transportation mode, such  as  walking,  driving,  etc.,  implied  in  a  user s  gps  data  can provide  us  valuable  knowledge  to  understand  the  user.  it  also enables  context-aware  computing  based  on  user s  present transportation mode and design of an innovative user interface for web  users.  our  approach  consists  of  three parts  a  change  point-based  segmentation  method,  an  inference  model  and  a  post-processing  algorithm  based  on  conditional  probability.  the change point-based segmentation method was compared with two baselines  including  uniform  duration  based  and  uniform  length based  methods.  meanwhile,  four  different  inference  models including  decision  tree,  bayesian  net,  support  vector  machine (svm)  and  conditional  random  field  (crf)  are  studied  in  the experiments.  we  evaluated  the  approach  using  the  gps  data collected by 45 users over six months period. as a result, beyond other  two  segmentation  methods,  the  change  point based  method achieved a higher degree of accuracy in predicting transportation modes  and  detecting  transitions  between  them.  decision  tree outperformed other inference models over the change point based segmentation method.
