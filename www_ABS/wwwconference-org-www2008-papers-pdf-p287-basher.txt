peer-to-peer (p2p) applications continue to grow in popularity, and have reportedly overtaken web applications as the single largest contributor to internet tra c. using traces collected from a large edge network, we conduct an extensive analysis of p2p tra c, compare p2p tra c with web tra c, and discuss the implications of increased p2p tra c. in addition to studying the aggregate p2p tra c, we also analyze and compare the two main constituents of p2p traf- c in our data, namely bittorrent and gnutella. the results presented in the paper may be used for generating synthetic workloads, gaining insights into the functioning of p2p applications, and developing network management strategies. for example, our results suggest that new models are necessary for internet tra c. as a  rst step, we present  ow-level distributional models for web and p2p tra c that may be used in network simulation and emulation experiments.
