for many users with a physical or motor disability, using a computer mouse or other pointing device to navigate the web is cumbersome or impossible due to problems with pointing accuracy. at the same time, web accessibility using a keyboard in major browsers is rudimentary, requiring many key presses to select links or other elements. we introduce key-surf, a character controlled web navigation system which addresses this situation by presenting an interface which allows a user to activate any web page element with only two or three keystrokes. through an implementation of a user-centric incremental search algorithm, elements are matched according to user expectation as characters are entered into the interface. we show how our interface can be integrated with a speech recognition input, as well as with specialized onscreen keyboards for people with disabilities. using the user s browsing history, we improve the e ciency of the selection process and  nd potentially interesting page links for the user within the current web page. we present the results from a pilot study evaluating the performance of various components of our system.
