we consider the problem of ranking re nement, i.e., to improve the accuracy of an existing ranking function with a small set of labeled instances. we are, particularly, interested in learning a better ranking function using two complementary sources of information, ranking information given by the existing ranking function (i.e., the base ranker) and that obtained from users  feedbacks. this problem is very important in information retrieval where feedbacks are gradually collected. the key challenge in combining the two sources of information arises from the fact that the ranking information presented by the base ranker tends to be imperfect and the ranking information obtained from users  feedbacks tends to be noisy. we present a novel boosting algorithm for ranking re nement that can e ectively leverage the uses of the two sources of information. our empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm is e ective for ranking re nement, and furthermore it signi cantly outperforms the baseline algorithms that incorporate the outputs from the base ranker as an additional feature.
