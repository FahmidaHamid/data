in many cases, rather than a keyword search, people intend to see what  is  going  on  through  the  internet.  then  the  integrated comprehensive information on news topics is necessary, which we called  news  issues,  including  the  background,  history,  current progress,  different  opinions  and  discussions,  etc.  traditionally, news issues are manually generated by website editors. it is quite a  time-consuming  hard  work,  and  hence  real-time  update  is difficult  to  perform.  in  this  paper,  a  three-step  automatic  online algorithm for news issue construction is proposed. the first step is a  topic  detection  process,  in  which  newly  appearing  stories  are clustered  into  new  topic  candidates.  the  second  step  is  a  topic tracking  process,  where  those  candidates  are  compared  with previous topics, either merged into old ones or generating a new one.  in  the  final  step,  news  issues  are  constructed  by  the combination of related topics and updated by the insertion of new topics. an automatic online news issue construction process under practical web circumstances  is  simulated  to  perform  news  issue construction  experiments.  f-measure  of  the  best  results  is  either above (topic detection) or close to (topic detection and tracking) 90%.  four  news  issue  construction  results  are  successfully generated in different time granularities one meets the needs like  what s  new ,  and  the  other  three  will  answer  questions  like  what s  hot   or   what s  going  on .  through  the  proposed algorithm,  news  issues  can  be  effectively  and  automatically constructed with real-time update, and lots of human efforts will be released from tedious manual work.
