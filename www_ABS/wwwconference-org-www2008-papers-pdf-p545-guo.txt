in this  paper,  client-site  web  mashups  are  studied  from component-oriented  perspective,  and  compoweb,  a  component-oriented  web  architecture,  is  proposed.  in  compoweb,  a  web application is decomposed into web components called gadgets. a  gadget  is  an  abstraction  of  functional  or  logical  web component.  it  is  isolated  from  other  gadgets  for  security  and reliability.  contract-based  channels  are  the  only  way  to  interact with  each  other.  an  abstraction  of  contract-based  channels supported  or  required  by  a  gadget  is  also  presented.  it  enables binding of gadgets at deployment, and promotes interchangeable gadgets.  unlike  the  model  of  a  normal  function  call  where  the function logic is executed in caller s context, compoweb ensures that the function logic is executed in callee s context so that both the caller and callee are protected. implementation of a prototype compoweb system and its performance are also presented.
