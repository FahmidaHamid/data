wiki content templating enables reuse of content structures among wiki pages. in this paper we present a thorough study of this widespread feature, showing how its two state of the art models (functional and creational templating) are sub-optimal. we then propose a third, better, model called lightly constrained (lc) templating and show its implementation in the moin wiki engine. we also show how lc tem-plating implementations are the appropriate technologies to push forward semantically rich web pages on the lines of (lowercase) semantic web and microformats.
