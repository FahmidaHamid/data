the semantic web is based on accessing and reusing rdf data from many di erent sources, which one may assign di erent levels of authority and credibility. existing semantic web query languages, like sparql, have targeted the retrieval, combination and reuse of facts, but have so far ignored all aspects of meta knowledge, such as origins, authorship, recency or certainty of data, to name but a few. in this paper, we present an original, generic, formalized and implemented approach for managing many dimensions of meta knowledge, like source, authorship, certainty and others. the approach reuses existing rdf modeling possibilities in order to represent meta knowledge. then, it extends sparql query processing in such a way that given a sparql query for data, one may request meta knowledge without modifying the original query. thus, our approach achieves highly  exible and automatically coordinated querying for data and meta knowledge, while completely separating the two areas of concern.
