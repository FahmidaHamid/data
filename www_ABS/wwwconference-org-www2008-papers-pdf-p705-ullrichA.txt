the term  web 2.0  is used to describe applications that distinguish themselves from previous generations of software by a number of principles. existing work shows that web 2.0 applications can be successfully exploited for technology-enhance learning. however, in-depth analyses of the relationship between web 2.0 technology on the one hand and teaching and learning on the other hand are still rare. in this article, we will analyze the technological principles of the web 2.0 and describe their pedagogical implications on learning. we will furthermore show that web 2.0 is not only well suited for learning but also for research on learning the wealth of services that is available and their openness regarding api and data allow to assemble prototypes of technology-supported learning applications in amazingly small amount of time. these prototypes can be used to evaluate research hypotheses quickly. we will present two example prototypes and discuss the lessons we learned from building and using these prototypes.
