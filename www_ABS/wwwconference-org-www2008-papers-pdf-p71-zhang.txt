this  paper the  problem  of  imbalanced classification  (ic)  in  web  mining,  which  often  arises  on  the  web due to the  matthew effect . as web ic applications usually need to provide online service for user and deal with large volume of data, classification speed emerges as an important issue to be addressed. in  face  detection,  asymmetric  cascade  is  used  to  speed  up imbalanced classification by building a cascade structure of simple classifiers, but it often causes a loss of classification accuracy due to the iterative feature addition in its learning procedure.  in this paper, we adopt the idea of cascade classifier in imbalanced web mining for  fast  classification  and  propose  a  novel  asymmetric  cascade learning method called floatcascade to improve the accuracy. to the end, floatcascade selects fewer  yet  more  effective  features  at each  stage  of  the  cascade  classifier.  in  addition,  a  decision-tree scheme is adopted to enhance feature diversity and discrimination capability  for  floatcascade  learning.  we  evaluate  floatcascade through  two  typical  ic  applications  in  web  mining  web  page categorization  and  citation  matching.  experimental results demonstrate  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  floatcascade comparing  to  the  state-of-the-art  ic  methods  like  asymmetric cascade, asymmetric adaboost and weighted svm.
