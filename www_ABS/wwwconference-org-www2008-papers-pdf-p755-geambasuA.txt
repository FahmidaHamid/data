the migration from desktop applications to web-based services is scattering personal data across a myriad of web sites, such as google, flickr, youtube, and amazon s3. this dispersal poses new challenges for users, making it more dif cult for them to (1) organize, search, and archive their data, much of which is now hosted by web sites; (2) create heterogeneous, multi-web-service object collections and share them in a protected way; and (3) manipulate their data with standard applications or scripts. in this paper, we show that a web-service interface supporting standardized naming, protection, and object-access services can solve these problems and can greatly simplify the creation of a new generation of object-management services for the web. we describe the implementation of menagerie, a proof-of-concept prototype that provides these services for web-based applications. at a high level, menagerie creates an integrated  le and object system from heterogeneous, personal web-service objects dispersed across the internet. we present several object-management applications we developed on menagerie to show the practicality and bene ts of our approach.
