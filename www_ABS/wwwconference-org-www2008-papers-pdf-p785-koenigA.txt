ws-bpel de nes a standard for executable processes. executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an it infrastructure. the ws-bpel speci- cation also introduces the concept of abstract processes in contrast to their executable siblings, abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised. nevertheless, the ws-bpel speci cation introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-speci ed abstract process and a fully speci ed executable one. basically, this compatibility notion de nes a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by pro les. so far, there exist two of such pro les the abstract process pro le for observable behavior and the abstract process pro le for templates. none of these pro les de nes a concept of behavioral equivalence. therefore, both pro les are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one. in this paper, we propose a novel pro le that extends the existing abstract process pro le for observable behavior by de n-ing a behavioral relationship. we also show that our novel pro le allows for more  exibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible.
