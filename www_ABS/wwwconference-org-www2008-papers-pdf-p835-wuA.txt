finding the occurrences of structural patterns in xml data is a key operation in xml query processing. existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on path-patterns or tree-patterns. requirements in  exible querying of xml data have motivated recently the introduction of query languages that allow a partial speci cation of path-patterns in a query. in this paper, we focus on the ef cient evaluation of partial path queries, a generalization of path pattern queries. our approach explicitly deals with repeated labels (that is, multiple occurrences of the same label in a query). we show that partial path queries can be represented as rooted dags for which a topological ordering of the nodes exists. we present three algorithms for the ef cient evaluation of these queries under the indexed streaming evaluation model. the  rst one exploits a structural summary of data to generate a set of path-patterns that together are equivalent to a partial path query. to evaluate these path-patterns, we extend pathstack so that it can work on path-patterns with repeated labels. the second one extracts a spanning tree from the query dag, uses a stack-based algorithm to  nd the matches of the root-to-leaf paths in the tree, and merge-joins the matches to compute the answer. finally, the third one exploits multiple pointers of stack entries and a topological ordering of the query dag to apply a stack-based holistic technique. an analysis of the algorithms and extensive experimental evaluation shows that the holistic algorithm outperforms the other ones.
