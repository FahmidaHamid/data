we present a novel approach for  ltering xml documents using nondeterministic  nite automata and distributed hash tables. our approach di ers architecturally from recent proposals that deal with distributed xml  ltering; they assume an xml broker architecture, whereas our solution is built on top of distributed hash tables. the essence of our work is a distributed implementation of yfilter, a state-of-the-art automata-based xml  ltering system on top of chord. we experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate that our algorithms can scale to millions of xpath queries under various  ltering scenarios, and also exhibit very good load balancing properties.
