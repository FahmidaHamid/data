with telecom market reaching saturation in many geographies and revenues from voice calls decreasing, telecom operators are trying to identify new sources of revenue. for this purpose, these operators can take advantage of their core functionalities like location, call control, etc. by exposing them as services to be composed by developers with third party o(cid11)erings available over the web. to hide the complexity of underlying telecom protocols from application developers, the operators are steadily adopting service oriented architecture (soa) and reference standards like parlay-x and ims. however, a number of challenges still remain in rapid utilization of telecom functionalities for creating new applications - existence of multiple protocols, different classes of developers, and the need to coordinate and manage usage of these functionalities. in this paper, we present sewnet, a framework for creating applications exploiting telecom functionality exposed over a (converged) ip network. more speci(cid12)cally, sewnet a) provides an abstraction model for encapsulating invocation, coordination and enrichment of the telecom functionalities, b) renders a service creation environment on top of this model, and c) caters to various di(cid11)erent categories of developers. with the help of two use-case scenarios, we demonstrate how sewnet can create services utilizing rich telecom functionality.
