this paper presents a general framework for building classi- ers that deal with short and sparse text & web segments by making the most of hidden topics discovered from large-scale data collections. the main motivation of this work is that many classi cation tasks working with short segments of text & web, such as search snippets, forum & chat messages, blog & news feeds, product reviews, and book & movie summaries, fail to achieve high accuracy due to the data sparseness. we, therefore, come up with an idea of gaining external knowledge to make the data more related as well as expand the coverage of classi ers to handle future data better. the underlying idea of the framework is that for each classi cation task, we collect a large-scale external data collection called  universal dataset , and then build a classi er on both a (small) set of labeled training data and a rich set of hidden topics discovered from that data collection. the framework is general enough to be applied to di erent data domains and genres ranging from web search results to medical text. we did a careful evaluation on several hundred megabytes of wikipedia (30m words) and medline (18m words) with two tasks  web search domain disambiguation  and  disease categorization for medical text , and achieved signi cant quality enhancement.
