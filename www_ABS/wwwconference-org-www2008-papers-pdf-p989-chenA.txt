current  search  mechanisms  of  dht-based  p2p  systems  can  well handle a single keyword search problem. other than single keyword search, multi-keyword search is quite popular and  useful  in  many real  applications.  simply  using  the  solution  for  single  keyword search will require distributed intersection/union operations in wide area  networks,  leading  to  unacceptable  traffic  cost.  as  it  is  well known  that  bloom  filter  (bf)  is  effective  in  reducing  traffic,  we would like to use bf encoding to handle multi-keyword search. applying bf is not difficult, but how to get optimal results is not trivial. in this study we show, through mathematical proof, that the optimal setting of bf in terms of traffic cost is determined by the global statistical information of keywords, not the minimized false positive  rate  as  claimed  by  previous  methods.  through  extensive experiments,  we  demonstrate  how  to  obtain  optimal  settings.  we further argue that the intersection order between sets is important for multi-keyword  search.  thus,  we  design  optimal  order  strategies based on bf for both  and  and  or  queries.  to better evaluate the performance  of  this  design,  we  conduct  extensive  simulations  on trec  wt10g  test  collection  and  the  query  log  of  a  commercial search engine. results show that our design significantly reduces the search traffic of existing approach by 73%.
