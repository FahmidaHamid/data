traditional relation extraction methods require pre-speci ed relations and relation-speci c human-tagged examples. bootstrapping systems signi cantly reduce the number of training examples, but they usually apply heuristic-based methods to combine a set of strict hard rules, which limit the ability to generalize and thus generate a low recall. furthermore, existing bootstrapping methods do not perform open information extraction (open ie), which can identify various types of relations without requiring pre-speci cations. in this paper, we propose a statistical extraction framework called statistical snowball (statsnowball), which is a bootstrapping system and can perform both traditional relation extraction and open ie. statsnowball uses the discriminative markov logic networks (mlns) and softens hard rules by learning their weights in a maximum likelihood estimate sense. mln is a general model, and can be con gured to perform di erent levels of relation extraction. in statsnwoball, pattern selection is performed by solving an  1-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation, which enjoys well-founded theories and e cient solvers. we extensively evaluate the performance of statsnowball in di erent con gurations on both a small but fully labeled data set and large-scale web data. empirical results show that statsnowball can achieve a signi cantly higher recall without sacri cing the high precision during iterations with a small number of seeds, and the joint inference of mln can improve the performance. finally, statsnowball is e cient and we have developed a working entity relation search engine called renlifang based on it.
