we analyze knowledge production in computer science by means of coauthorship networks. for this, we consider 30 graduate programs of di erent regions of the world, being 8 programs in brazil, 16 in north america (3 in canada and 13 in the united states), and 6 in europe (2 in france, 1 in switzerland and 3 in the united kingdom). we use a dataset that consists of 176,537 authors and 352,766 publication entries distributed among 2,176 publication venues. the results obtained for di erent metrics of collaboration social networks indicate the process of knowledge production has  achanged di erently for each region. research is increasingly done in teams across di erent  elds of computer science. the size of the giant component indicates the existence of isolated collaboration groups in the european network, contrasting to the degree of connectivity found in the brazilian and north-american counterparts. we also analyzed the temporal evolution of the social networks representing the three regions. the number of authors per paper experienced an increase in a time span of 12 years. we observe that the number of collaborations between authors grows faster than the number of authors, bene ting from the existing network structure. the temporal evolution shows di erences between well-established  elds, such as databases and computer architecture, and emerging  elds, like bioinformatics and geoinformatics. the patterns of collaboration analyzed in this paper contribute to an overall understanding of computer science research in di erent geographical regions that could not be achieved without the use of complex networks and a large publication database.
