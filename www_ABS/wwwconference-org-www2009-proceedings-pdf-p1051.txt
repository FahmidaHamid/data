existing  keyword  suggestion  tools  from  various  search  engine companies  could  automatically  suggest  keywords  related  to  the advertisers  products or services, counting in simple statistics of the keywords,  such  as  search  volume,  cost  per  click  (cpc),  etc. however,  the  nature  of  the  generalized  second  price  auction suggests  that  better  understanding  the  competitors   keyword selection and bidding strategies better helps to win the auction, other than  only  relying  on  general  search  statistics.  in  this  paper,  we propose  a  novel  keyword  suggestion  strategy,  called  competitive analysis,  to  explore  the  keyword  based  competition  relationships among  advertisers  and  eventually  help  advertisers to  build campaigns  with  better  performance.  the  experimental  results demonstrate that the proposed competitive analysis can both help advertisers  to  promote  their  product  selling  and  generate  more revenue to the search engine companies.
