in this paper we describe a problem of discovering query clusters from  a  click-through  graph  of  web  search  logs.    the  graph consists of a set of web search queries, a set of pages selected for the queries, and a set of directed edges that connects a query node and a page node  clicked by a user for  the query.  the proposed method  extracts  all  maximal  bipartite  cliques  (bicliques)  from  a click-through  graph  and  compute  an  equivalence  set  of  queries (i.e.,  a  query  cluster)  from  the  maximal  bicliques.    a  cluster  of queries  is  formed  from  the  queries  in  a  biclique.    we  present  a scalable algorithm that enumerates all maximal bicliques from the click-through  graph.  we  have  conducted  experiments  on  yahoo web search queries and the result is promising.
