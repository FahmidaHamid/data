the emergence of semantic web technologies and standards such as  resource  description  framework  (rdf)  has  introduced  novel data storage models such as the rdf graph model. in this paper, we present a research effort called r2d, which attempts to bridge the  gap  between  rdf  and  rdbms  concepts  by  presenting  a relational  view  of  rdf  data  stores.    thus,  r2d  is  essentially  a relational wrapper around rdf stores that aims to make the variety of stable relational tools that are currently in the market available to rdf stores without data duplication and synchronization issues.
