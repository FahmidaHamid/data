in a traditional keyword-search system in xml data, a user composes a keyword query, submits it to the system, and retrieves relevant subtrees. in the case where the user has limited knowledge about the data, often the user feels  left in the dark  when issuing queries, and has to use a try-and-see approach for  nding information. in this paper, we study a new information-access paradigm for xml data, called  inks,  in which the system searches on the underlying data  on the  y  as the user types in query keywords. inks extends existing xml keyword search methods by interactively answering keyword queries. we propose e ective indices, early-termination techniques, and e cient search algorithms to achieve a high interactive speed. we have implemented our algorithm. the experimental results show that inks achieves high search e ciency and result quality.
