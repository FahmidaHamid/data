in this paper, we propose to model the blended search problem by assuming  conditional  dependencies  among  queries,  vses  and search  results.  the  probability  distributions  of  this  model  are learned  from  search  engine  query  log  through  unigram  language model.  our  experimental  exploration  shows  that,  (1)  a  large number  of  queries  in  generic  web  search  have  vertical  search intentions;  and  (2)  our  proposed  algorithm  can  effectively  blend vertical  search  results  into  generic  web  search,  which  can improve the mean average precision (map) by as much as 16% compared to traditional web search without blending.
