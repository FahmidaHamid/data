more and more structured information in the form of semantic data is nowadays available. it o ers a wide range of new possibilities especially for semantic search and web data integration. however, their e ective exploitation still brings about a number of challenges, e.g. usability, scalability and uncertainty. in this paper, we present dataplorer, a solution designed to address these challenges. we consider the usability through the use of hybrid queries and faceted search, while still preserving the scalability thanks to an extension of inverted index to support this type of query. moreover, dataplorer deals with uncertainty by means of a powerful ranking scheme to  nd relevant results. our experimental results show that our proposed approach is promising and it makes us believe that it is possible to extend the current ir infrastructure to query and search the web of data.
