this paper identi es and explores the problem of seed selection in a web-scale crawler. we argue that seed selection is not a trivial but very important problem. selecting proper seeds can increase the number of pages a crawler will discover, and can result in a collection with more  good  and less  bad  pages. based on the analysis of the graph structure of the web, we propose several seed selection algorithms. e ectiveness of these algorithms is proved by our experimental results on real web data.
