the abundant knowledge in web communities has motivated the research interests in discussion threads. the dynamic nature of discussion threads poses interesting and challenging problems for computer scientists. although techniques such as semantic models or structural models have been shown to be useful in a number of areas, they are ine -cient in understanding discussion threads due to the temporal dependence among posts in a discussion thread. such dependence causes that semantics and structure coupled with each other in discussion threads. in this paper, we propose a sparse coding-based model named smss to simultaneously model semantic and structure of discussion threads.
