we show how a number of novel email search features can be implemented without any kind of natural language processing (nlp) or advanced data mining. our approach inspects the email headers of all messages a user has ever sent or received and it creates simple per-contact summaries, including simple information about the message exchange history, the domain of the sender or even the sender s gender. with these summaries advanced questions/tasks such as  who do i still need to reply to?  or  find  fun  messages sent by friends.  become possible. as a proof of concept, we implemented a mozilla-thunderbird extension, adding powerful people search to the popular email client.
