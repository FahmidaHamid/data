in  this  paper  we  present  an  approach  of  generating  cascading style sheet documents automatically if the desired effect on the content  elements  is  specified.  while  a  web  user  agent  resolves the css rules and computes their effect, our approach handles the way  back.  we  argue,  that  this  can  remarkably  improve  css productivity, since the process of css authoring always involves this  direction  implicitly.  our  approach  claims  a  new  and innovative  way  to  reuse  chunks  of  markup  together  with  its presentation.  it  furthermore  bears  potential  for  the  optimization and  reorganization  of  css  documents.  we  describe  criteria  for css  code  quality  we  oriented  on,  including  a  quantitative indicator for the abstractness of a css presentation specification. an evaluation and recomputation  of  the  css  for  25.000  html documents shows that concerning these criteria the automatically generated code comes close to manually authored code.
