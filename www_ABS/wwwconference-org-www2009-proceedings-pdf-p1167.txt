in this paper, we study how the performance and usability of web dialogue  systems  could  be  enhanced  by  using  an  appropriate representation  of  the  different  types  of  knowledge  involved  in communication  general  dialogue  mechanisms,  specific  domain-restricted linguistic and conceptual knowledge and information on how  well  the  communication  process  is  doing.  we  describe  the experiments  carried  out this knowledge  representation  in  the  web  dialogue  system  we developed.
