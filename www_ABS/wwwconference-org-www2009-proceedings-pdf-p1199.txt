in order to create more attractive tagclouds that get people interested in tagged content, we propose a simple but novel tagcloud where font size is determined by tag s entropy value, not the popularity to its content. our method raises users  emotional interest in the content by emphasizing more emotional tags. our initial experiments show that emotional tagclouds attract more attention than normal tagclouds at  rst look; thus they will enhance the role of tagcloud as a social signaller.
