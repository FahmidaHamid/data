a  pressing  task  during  the  unification  process  is  to  identify  a user s vertical search intention based on the user s query. in this paper, we propose a novel method to propagate social annotation, which includes user-supplied tag data, to both queries and vses for semantically bridging them. our proposed algorithm consists of three key steps query annotation, vertical annotation and query intention  identification.  our  algorithm,  referred  to  as  tagqv, verifies  that  the  social  tagging  can  be  propagated  to  represent web  objects  such  as  queries  and  vses  besides  web  pages. experiments  on  real  web  search  queries  demonstrate the effectiveness of tagqv in query intention identification.
