social media websites promote diverse user interaction on media objects  as  well  as  user  actions  with  respect  to  other  users.  the goal of this work is to discover community structure in rich media social  networks,  and  observe  how  it  evolves  over  time,  through analysis of multi-relational data. the problem is important in  the enterprise domain where extracting emergent community structure on enterprise social media, can help in forming new collaborative teams,  aid  in  expertise  discovery,  and  guide  long  term  enterprise reorganization.  our  approach  consists  of  three  main  parts  (1)  a relational  hypergraph  model  for  modeling  various  social  context and interactions; (2) a novel hypergraph factorization method for community  extraction  on  multi-relational  social  data;  (3)  an  online  method  to  handle  temporal  evolution  through  incremental hypergraph  factorization.  extensive  experiments  on  real-world enterprise  data  suggest  that  our  technique  is  scalable  and  can extract  meaningful  communities.  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  our mining  results,  we  use  our  method  to  predict  users   future interests. our prediction outperforms baseline methods (frequency counts,  plsa)  by  36-250%  on  the  average,  indicating  the  utility of leveraging multi-relational social context by using our method.
