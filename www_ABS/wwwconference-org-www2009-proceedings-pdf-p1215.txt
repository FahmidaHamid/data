searching  posts  effectively  has  become  an  important  issue  in large-scale online communities. especially, if search users have different inclinations when they search posts, they have different kinds  of  posts  in  their  minds.  to  address  this  problem,  in  this paper,  we  propose  a  scheme  of  ranking  posts  based  on  search users   inclination.  user  ranking  score  is  employed  to  capture posts that are relevant to a specific user inclination. specifically, we present a scheme to rank posts in terms of user expertise and popularity.  experimental  results  show that  different  user inclinations  can  produce  quite  different  search  results  and  the proposed scheme achieves about 70 % accuracy.
