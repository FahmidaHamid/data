tasks recognizing named entities such as products, people names, or locations from documents have recently received signi cant attention in the literature. many solutions to these tasks assume the existence of reference entity tables. an important challenge that needs to be addressed in the entity extraction task is that of ascertaining whether or not a candidate string approximately matches with a named entity in a given reference table. prior approaches have relied on string-based similarity which only compare a candidate string and an entity it matches with. in this paper, we exploit web search engines in order to de ne new similarity functions. we then develop e cient techniques to facilitate approximate matching in the context of our proposed similarity functions. in an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the accuracy and e ciency of our techniques.
