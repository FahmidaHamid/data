the explosion of online content has made the management of such content nontrivial. web-related tasks such as web page categorization, news  ltering, query categorization, tag recommendation, etc. often involve the construction of multi-label categorization systems on a large scale. existing multi-label classi cation methods either do not scale or have unsatisfactory performance. in this work, we propose metala-beler to automatically determine the relevant set of labels for each instance without intensive human involvement or expensive cross-validation. extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data show that the metalabeler tends to outperform existing methods. moreover, metalabeler scales to millions of multi-labeled instances and can be deployed easily. this enables us to apply the metalabeler to a large scale query categorization problem in yahoo!, yielding a sig-ni cant improvement in performance.
