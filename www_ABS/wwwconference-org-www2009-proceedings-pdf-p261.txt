behavioral  targeting  (bt)  is  a  technique  used  by  online advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns, and is playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  online  advertising market. however, it is underexplored in academia how  much bt can  truly  help  online  advertising  in  search  engines.  in  this  paper we  provide  an  empirical  study  on  the  click-through  log  of advertisements collected from a  commercial search engine. from the experiment results over a period of seven days, we draw three important  conclusions  (1)  users  who  clicked  the  same  ad  will truly have similar behaviors on the web; (2) click-through rate (ctr)  of  an  ad  can  be  averagely  improved  as  high  as  670%  by properly segmenting users for behavioral targeted advertising in a sponsored search; (3) using short term user behaviors to represent users is more effective than using long term user behaviors for bt. we conducted statistical t-test which verified that all conclusions drawn in the paper are statistically significant. to the best of our knowledge,  this  work  is  the  first  empirical  study  for  bt  on  the click-through log of real world ads.
