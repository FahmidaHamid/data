this paper proposes and evaluates a network aware forward caching approach for determining the optimal deployment strategy of forward caches to a network. a key advantage of this approach is that we can reduce the network costs associated with forward caching to maximize the bene t obtained from their deployment. we show in our simulation that a 37% increase to net bene ts could be achieved over the standard method of full cache deployment to cache all pops traf c. in addition, we show that this maximal point occurs when only 68% of the total traf c is cached. another contribution of this paper is the analysis we use to motivate and evaluate this problem. we characterize the internet traf c of 100k subscribers of a us residential broadband provider. we use both layer 4 and layer 7 analysis to investigate the traf c volumes of the  ows as well as study the general characteristics of the applications used. we show that http is a dominant protocol and account for 68% of the total downstream traf c and that 34% of that traf c is multimedia. in addition, we show that multimedia content using http exhibits a 83% annualized growth rate and other http traf c has a 53% growth rate versus the 26% over all annual growth rate of broadband traf c. this shows that http traf c will become ever more dominent and increase the potential caching opportunities. furthermore, we characterize the core backbone traf c of this broadband provider to measure the distance travelled by content and traf c. we  nd that cdn traf c is much more ef cient than p2p content and that there is large skew in the air miles between pop in a typical network. our  ndings show that there are many opportunties in broadband provider networks to optimize how traf c is delivered and cached.
