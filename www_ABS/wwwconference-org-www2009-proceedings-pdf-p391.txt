quicklinks for a website are navigational shortcuts displayed below the website homepage on a search results page, and that let the users directly jump to selected points inside the website. since the real-estate on a search results page is constrained and valuable, picking the best set of quicklinks to maximize the bene ts for a majority of the users becomes an important problem for search engines. using user browsing trails obtained from browser toolbars, and a simple probabilistic model, we formulate the quicklink selection problem as a combinatorial optimizaton problem. we  rst demonstrate the hardness of the objective, and then propose an algorithm that is provably within a factor of (1  1/e) of the optimal. we also propose a di erent algorithm that works on trees and that can  nd the optimal solution; unlike the previous algorithm, this algorithm can incorporate natural constraints on the set of chosen quicklinks. the e cacy of our methods is demonstrated via empirical results on both a manually labeled set of websites and a set for which quick-link click-through rates for several webpages were obtained from a real-world search engine.
