motivated by contextual advertising systems and other web applications involving e ciency accuracy tradeo s, we study similarity caching. here, a cache hit is said to occur if the requested item is similar but not necessarily equal to some cached item. we study two objectives that dictate the e ciency accuracy tradeo  and provide our caching policies for these objectives. by conducting extensive experiments on real data we show similarity caching can signi -cantly improve the e ciency of contextual advertising systems, with minimal impact on accuracy. inspired by the above, we propose a simple generative model that embodies two fundamental characteristics of page requests arriving to advertising systems, namely, long-range dependences and similarities. we provide theoretical bounds on the gains of similarity caching in this model and demonstrate these gains empirically by  tting the actual data to the model.
