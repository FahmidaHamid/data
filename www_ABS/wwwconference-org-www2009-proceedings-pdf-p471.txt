understanding  the  intent  behind  a  user s  query  can  help  search engine  to  automatically  route  the  query  to  some  corresponding vertical  search  engines  to  obtain  particularly  relevant  contents, thus,  greatly  improving  user  satisfaction.  there  are  three  major challenges  to  the  query  intent  classification  problem  (1)  intent representation; (3)  semantic interpretation.  current  approaches  to  predict  the  user s  intent mainly  utilize  machine  learning  techniques.  however,  it  is difficult  and  often  requires  many  human  efforts  to  meet  all  these challenges  by  the  statistical  machine  learning  approaches.  in  this paper, we propose a general methodology to the problem of query intent classification. with very little human effort, our method can discover leveraging wikipedia, one of the best human knowledge base. the wikipedia concepts  are  used  as  the  intent  representation  space,  thus,  each intent  domain  is  represented  as  a  set  of  wikipedia  articles  and categories.  the  intent  of  any  input  query  is  identified  through mapping  the  query  into  the  wikipedia  representation  space. compared  with  previous  approaches,  our  proposed  method  can achieve  much  better  coverage  to  classify  queries  in  an  intent domain  even  through  the number  of  seed intent  examples is  very small.  moreover,  the  method  is  very  general  and  can  be  easily applied the effectiveness  of  this  method  in  three  different  applications,  i.e., travel,  job,  and  person  name.  in  each  of  the  three  cases,  only  a couple  of  seed  intent  queries  are  provided.  we  perform  the quantitative evaluations in comparison with two baseline methods, and  the  experimental  results  show  that  our  method  significantly outperforms other approaches in each intent domain. intent  domains.  we  demonstrate large  quantities  of intent  concepts  by to  various
