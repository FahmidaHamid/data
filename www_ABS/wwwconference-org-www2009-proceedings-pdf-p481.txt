discovering users  speci c and implicit geographic intention in web search can greatly help satisfy users  information needs. we build a geo intent analysis system that uses minimal supervision to learn a model from large amounts of web-search logs for this discovery. we build a city language model, which is a probabilistic representation of the language surrounding the mention of a city in web queries. we use several features derived from these language models to (1) identify users  implicit geo intent and pinpoint the city corresponding to this intent, (2) determine whether the geo-intent is localized around the users  current geographic location, (3) predict cities for queries that have a mention of an entity that is located in a speci c place. experimental results demonstrate the e ectiveness of using features derived from the city language model. we  nd that (1) the system has over 90% precision and more than 74% accuracy for the task of detecting users  implicit city level geo intent (2) the system achieves more than 96% accuracy in determining whether implicit geo queries are local geo queries, neighbor region geo queries or none-of these (3) the city language model can e ectively retrieve cities in location-speci c queries with high precision (88%) and recall (74%); human evaluation shows that the language model predicts city labels for location-speci c queries with high accuracy (84.5%).
