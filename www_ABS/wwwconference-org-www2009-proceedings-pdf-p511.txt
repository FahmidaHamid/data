sponsored search systems are tasked with matching queries to relevant advertisements. the current state-of-the-art matching algorithms expand the user s query using a variety of external resources, such as web search results. while these expansion-based algorithms are highly e ective, they are largely ine cient and cannot be applied in real-time. in practice, such algorithms are applied o ine to popular queries, with the results of the expensive operations cached for fast access at query time. in this paper, we describe an e cient and e ective approach for matching ads against rare queries that were not processed o ine. the approach builds an expanded query representation by leveraging o ine processing done for related popular queries. our experimental results show that our approach signi cantly improves the e ectiveness of advertising on rare queries with only a negligible increase in computational cost.
