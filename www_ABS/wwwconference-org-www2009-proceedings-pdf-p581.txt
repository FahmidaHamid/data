the use of rdf data published on the web for applications is still a cumbersome and resource-intensive task due to the limited software support and the lack of standard programming paradigms to deal with everyday problems such as combination of rdf data from di erent sources, object iden-ti er consolidation, ontology alignment and mediation, or plain querying and  ltering tasks. in this paper we present semantic web pipes that support fast implementation of semantic data mashups while preserving desirable properties such as abstraction, encapsulation, component-orientation, code re-usability and maintainability which are common and well supported in other application areas.
