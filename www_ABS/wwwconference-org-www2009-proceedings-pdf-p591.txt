we tackle the problem of disambiguating entities on the web. we propose a user-driven scheme where graphs of entities   represented by globally identi able declarative artifacts   self-organize in a dynamic and probabilistic manner. our solution has the following two desirable properties i) it lets end-users freely de ne associations between arbitrary entities and ii) it probabilistically infers entity relationships based on uncertain links using constraint-satisfaction mechanisms. we outline the interface between our scheme and the current data web, and show how higher-layer applications can take advantage of our approach to enhance search and update of information relating to online entities. we describe a decentralized infrastructure supporting ef cient and scalable entity disambiguation and demonstrate the practicability of our approach in a deployment over several hundreds of machines.
