in this paper we present triplify   a simplistic but e ective approach to publish linked data from relational databases. triplify is based on mapping http-uri requests onto relational database queries. triplify transforms the resulting relations into rdf statements and publishes the data on the web in various rdf serializations, in particular as linked data. the rationale for developing triplify is that the largest part of information on the web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by web applications only as html mixing structure, layout and content. in order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current web, we have implemented triplify as a lightweight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed web applications. our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. triplify is complemented by a library of con gura-tions for common relational schemata and a rest-enabled data source registry. triplify con gurations containing mappings are provided for many popular web applications, including oscommerce, wordpress, drupal, gallery, and ph-pbb. we will show that despite its lightweight architecture triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160gb of geo data from the openstreetmap project.
