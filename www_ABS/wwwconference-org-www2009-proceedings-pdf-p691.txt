in web-based services of dynamic content (such as news articles), recommender systems face the di culty of timely identifying new items of high-quality and providing recommendations for new users. we propose a feature-based machine learning approach to personalized recommendation that is capable of handling the cold-start issue e ectively. we maintain pro les of content of interest, in which temporal characteristics of the content, e.g. popularity and freshness, are updated in real-time manner. we also maintain pro les of users including demographic information and a summary of user activities within yahoo! properties. based on all features in user and content pro les, we develop predictive bilinear regression models to provide accurate personalized recommendations of new items for both existing and new users. this approach results in an o ine model with light computational overhead compared with other recommender systems that require online retraining. the proposed framework is general and  exible for other personalized tasks. the superior performance of our approach is veri ed on a large-scale data set collected from the today-module on yahoo! front page, with comparison against six competitive approaches.
