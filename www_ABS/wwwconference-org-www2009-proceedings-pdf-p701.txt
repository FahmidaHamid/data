the  algorithmic small-world hypothesis  states that not only are pairs of individuals in a large social network connected by short paths, but that ordinary individuals can  nd these paths. although theoretically plausible, empirical evidence for the hypothesis is limited, as most chains in  small-world  experiments fail to complete, thereby biasing estimates of  true  chain lengths. using data from two recent small-world experiments, comprising a total of 162,328 message chains, and directed at one of 30  targets  spread across 19 countries, we model heterogeneity in chain attrition rates as a function of individual attributes. we then introduce a rigorous way of estimating true chain lengths that is provably unbiased, and can account for empirically-observed variation in attrition rates. our  ndings provide mixed support for the algorithmic hypothesis. on the one hand, it appears that roughly half of all chains can be completed in 6-7 steps thus supporting the  six degrees of separation  assertion but on the other hand, estimates of the mean are much longer, suggesting that for at least some of the population, the world is not  small  in the algorithmic sense. we conclude that search distances in social networks are fundamentally di erent from topological distances, for which the mean and median of the shortest path lengths between nodes tend to be similar.
