we  present  a  logs-based  comparison  of  search  patterns  across three  platforms  computers,  iphones  and  conventional  mobile phones. our goal is to understand how mobile search users differ from  computer-based  search  users,  and  we  focus  heavily  on  the distribution and variability of tasks that users perform from each platform.  the  results  suggest  that  search  usage  is  much  more focused  for  the  average  mobile  user  than  for  the  average computer-based  user.  however,  search  behavior  on  high-end phones  resembles  computer-based  search  behavior  more  so  than mobile  search  behavior.  a  wide  variety  of  implications  follow from  these  findings.  first,  there  is  no  single  search  interface which is suitable for all mobile phones. we suggest that for the integration  with higher-end  phones,  a  close the  standard computer-based interface  (in terms  of  personalization  and available feature set) would be beneficial for the user, since these phones seem to be treated as an extension of the users' computer. for all other phones, there is a huge opportunity for personalizing the search experience for the user's "mobile needs", as these users are  likely  to  repeatedly  search  for  a  single  type  of  information need on their phone.
