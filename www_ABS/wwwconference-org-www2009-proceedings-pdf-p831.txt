the standard layout model used by web browsers is to lay text out in a vertical scroll using a single column. the horizontal-scroll layout model in which text is laid out in columns whose height is set to that of the browser window and the viewer scrolls horizontally seems well-suited to multi-column layout on electronic devices. we describe a study that examines how people read and, in particular, the strategies they use for scrolling with these two models when reading large textual documents on a standard computer monitor. we compare usability of the models and evaluate both user preferences and the e ect of the model on performance. also interesting is the description of the browser and its user interface which we used for the study.
