we  present  a  new  captcha  which  is  based  on  identifying  an image s  upright  orientation.  this  task  requires  analysis  of  the often complex contents of an image, a task which humans usually perform  well  and  machines  generally  do  not.    given  a  large repository of images, such as those from a web search result, we use  a  suite  of  automated  orientation  detectors  to  prune  those images  that  can  be  automatically  set  upright  easily.    we  then apply  a  social  feedback  mechanism  to  verify  that  the  remaining images have a human-recognizable upright orientation. the main advantages of our captcha technique over the traditional text recognition  techniques  are  that  it  is  language-independent,  does not  require  text-entry  (e.g.  for  a  mobile  device),  and  employs another  domain  for  captcha  generation  beyond  character obfuscation. this captcha lends itself to rapid implementation and  has  an  almost  limitless  supply  of  images.    we  conducted extensive experiments to measure the viability of this technique.
