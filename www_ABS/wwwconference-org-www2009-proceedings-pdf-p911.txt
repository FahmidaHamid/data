loose coupling is often quoted as a desirable property of systems architectures. one of the main goals of building systems using web technologies is to achieve loose coupling. however, given the lack of a widely accepted de nition of this term, it becomes hard to use coupling as a criterion to evaluate alternative web technology choices, as all options may exhibit, and claim to provide, some kind of  loose  coupling e ects. this paper presents a systematic study of the degree of coupling found in service-oriented systems based on a multifaceted approach. thanks to the metric introduced in this paper, coupling is no longer a one-dimensional concept with loose coupling found somewhere in between tight coupling and no coupling. the paper shows how the metric can be applied to real-world examples in order to support and improve the design process of service-oriented systems.
