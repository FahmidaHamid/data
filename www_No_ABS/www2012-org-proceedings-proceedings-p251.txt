Popularity plays a major role in the dynamics of online systems.
Public attention can suddenly concentrate on a Web page or application [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], a Youtube video [7,
 the news media [13], sometimes even in absence of an apparent reason.
Typically, after an initial increase of attention, the focus will move elsewhere leaving as a trace a characteristic activity pro le.
Such popularity peaks are not only of great relevance for the monetization of online content, Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).

In particular, speci c features of the popular item under consideration can now be related to its activity pro le by means of semantic analysis and natural language processing of the messages exchanged by the users [3, 15, 16].
Here we use data from the Twitter micro-blogging system to investigate the relation between activity pro les over time and content.
There are several reasons for selecting Twitter: It is one of the most popular online social networks, part of its message stream is programmatically accessible to the public [17], and the content of the messages is short, making it amenable to automated processing.
Twitter is used as an hybrid between a communication media and an online social network [10, 16] and hosts real-time discussion of current topics of popular interest.
We take advantage of the practice introduced by Twitter users of attaching  hashtags  to their messages as a way of explicitly marking the relevant topics.
Twitter has incentivated this practice by supporting hashtags in their Web interface and in their programmatic API, turning them into lightweight social annotations of the information streams users consume.
Here we focus our analysis on those hashtags that exhibited a popularity peak during our observation period, and systematically analyze the corresponding messages ( tweets ) by grounding the words they contain in a semantic lexicon.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on Twitter and in particular the literature on temporal patterns of Twitter activity.
Section 3 describes the Twitter dataset we used and the techniques we applied to select popular hashtags and their usage patterns.
In Section 4 we identify dynamical classes of hashtag usage and relate them to the semantics of the corresponding tweets.
In Section 5 we relate the same dynamical classes to the spreading properties of hashtags over the underlying social network.
Section 6 summarizes our  ndings and points to applications and further research directions.
Several aspects of Twitter have been extensively investigated in the literature, including its network topology [18, 19, 20], the relations and types of messages between users [21, 22], the internal information propagation [23, 24, 25], the credibility of information [26, 27], and even its potential as
 The possibility that popular trends or hashtags could be classi ed in groups have been discussed in Refs.
[10, 16, 12], and the e ect of semantic di erences on the persistence of a hashtag have also been considered [33].
The shape of peaks in popularity pro les has been used to classify the events in groups [7, 10, 34, 12].
The hypothesis that both the increase and decrease of public attention follow a power-law-like functional shape whose exponents de ne universality classes, in parallel to what occurs with phase transitions in critical phenomena, has been explored [7].
This approach, however, is di cult to apply to Twitter: the fast timescales involved and the highly reactive nature of Twitter make the time series very noisy and pose the challenge of characterizing activity dynamics in a way which is both robust and scalable.
The causes that underlie the existence of distinct classes of popularity are thought to be a combination of all the mechanisms that drive public attention.
News regarding a popular item can propagate either over the social network of the users of a given system   a so-called endogenous process   or it can be injected through mass media (exogenous driving).
The duality between exogenous and endogenous information propagation has permeated the analysis of popularity in several recent studies [7, 10, 8, 9], even though it is not always clear how to distinguish between them based solely on the shape of the respective popularity pro les [9].
Our dataset comprises about 130 million Twitter messages or tweets posted between November 20, 2008 and May 27,
 to their temporary privileged access to the Twitter data stream [35].
Each tweet includes textual content, an author, the time at which it was posted, whether or not it was in reply to another tweet, and additional metadata.
The collected tweets come from about 6.1 million unique user accounts.
In order to build a representation of the social network over which hashtag di usion takes place, we queried the Twitter REST API for the complete list of followers and friends of 3.5 million users.
We collected neighbor information for 2.7 million of them, the discrepancy being accounted for by users with a private pro le.
Using this information we constructed a directed follower network, where each edge takes on the direction in which information  ows: if user A follows user B, the respective social link points from B to A, as A can see B s status updates.
For the identi cation of topics, we extracted all the hashtags contained in the Twitter messages (by matching the tweet content to the pattern  #[a-zA-Z0-9 ]*  ).
Our dataset includes about 400, 000 distinct hashtags (see Table 1).
We selected the most popular topics by restricting our data to the hashtags used by at least 500 distinct users and to the messages containing at least one of such hashtags.
Based on this selection, we used for the following analysis about 1.7 million tweets and 402 popular hashtags.
Like most systems driven by human actions, Twitter exhibits bursty activity, circadian rhythms, and in general the total number of tweets total number of tweets with hashtags total number of hashtags total number of users average number of tweets per user




 Table 1: General statistics about the dataset full temporal complexity of a large-scale social aggregate.
Because of this, there is no single natural scale for investigating its temporal behavior, and the choice of a time scale is not neutral with respect to the phenomena one can study at that scale.
Here we choose to investigate activity at the scale of days, i.e., we do not study human dynamics at the level of minutes and seconds, nor phenomena driven by the circadian cycle, nor slower trends that develop over several weeks of months.
We analyze daily activity levels, and focus on events that are meaningful at that scale, such as the wait for a scheduled social event.
At the daily scale the popularity pro le of hashtags can look very di erent.
On visual inspection the individual temporal pro les of hashtag usage display behaviors that typically fall into one of the following three categories: continuous activity, periodic activity, or activity concentrated around an isolated peak.
Continuous-activity pro les are those for which a rather constant level of daily activity is maintained by the user community (e.g., music).
Hashtags with periodic activity pro les display series of spikes spaced by one or more weeks, or months (e.g., followfriday).
Finally, activity pro les with an isolated peak are characteristic of hashtags associated with a unique event to which a user community pays attention for a limited span of time (e.g., oscars).
In the following we will concentrate on this class of hashtags.
To identify activity peaks, for every hashtag H we compute the time series of daily activity, where the activity nH (i) on day i is de ned as the number of tweets containing H. In the following we will write n(i) to indicate the activity level of a generic hashtag.
We use a sliding window of 2L+1 days (L = 30) centered on day i0, T = [n(i0   L), n(i0   L +
 and let i0 slide along the activity time series for the hashtag.
Within this window we evaluate the baseline hashtag activity as the median nb of T .
Then, we de ne the outlier fraction p(i0) of the central day i0 as the relative di erence of the hashtag activity n(i0) with respect to the median baseline nb: p(i0) = [n(i0)   nb]/ max(nb, nmin).
Here nmin = 10 is a mininum activity level used to regularize the de nition of p(i0) for low activity values.
We say that there is an activity peak at i0 if p(i0) > pt, where pt is an arbitrary threshold value that in the following we set as pt = 10.
We checked that di erent values of the threshold do not change signi cantly our results, and that the same peaks can be identi ed by using di erent peak-detection techniques.
Of course it may happen that for a given hashtag H the time series nH (i) exhibits more than one peak.
Since we are interested in isolated popularity bursts, we ignore all peaks that are separated from other peaks by less than one week.
Finally, for every hashtag we select the peak (if any) with the highest p(i0) and we o set the day index so that for all hashtags the activity peak occurs on day 0, as shown in Fig. 1.
Using this method we select 115 peaks of daily hashtag activity: the corresponding hashtags are listed in meaning and a coarse classi cation.
To correlate the temporal activity patterns with content, we perform a simple semantic grounding of the tweets by using the WordNet [36] semantic lexicon.
For each tweet, we pre-process the text by removing user mentions (@username), hashtags, URLs and a standard set of English stop words.
Then, for each word we perform stemming (with the standard Porter algorithm), lemmatization, and we  nally attempt to look up in WordNet the corresponding synset (i.e., the basic node of the WordNet lexicon, a set of synonyms that refer to a single concept).
From now on we will refer to WordNet synsets as concepts.
Words for which no concept can be looked up in WordNet are ignored.
If few or no terms are successfully looked up in WordNet as English words, we attempt to identify the tweet language: we run the TextCat [37] language categorization algorithm on the text and we discard the tweet if English is not included in the top 10 most likely languages identi ed by TextCat.
Overall, the above analysis identi es about 18, 000 distinct concepts that are associated with the hashtags under study.
Typical examples of the activity pro les for the selected hashtags are shown in Figure 1.
The curves are centered around the day on which the popularity reaches its maximum (day 0).
The displayed time window spans one week before and after the peak.
In the top plots of Figure 1 the activity of four sample hashtags is reported as a function of time in days after the peak.
The bars on the top right display the percentage of activity before, at and after the peak.
The four hashtags exhibit di erent behaviors in terms of approach to the peak (dark blue bars) and relaxation after the peak (light blue bars).
The hashtag masters exhibits an anticipatory pattern, with a gradual buildup of activity before the peak.
The hashtag winnenden, conversely, corresponds to an unexpected event, with a sudden onset of activity followed by a gradual relaxation.
The hashtag watchmen displays both a gradual buildup of attention and a gradual relaxation after the peak.
Finally, the hashtag nsotu concentrates almost all of its activity during the single day of the peak.
In the middle plot row we show the activity of individual users as a function of time.
Users who have posted the hashtag at least once (within the observation interval) are ranked according to the time of  rst usage of the hashtag (rank along the ordinate axis): early adopters lie at the bottom and late adopters are at the top.
For each user, colored segments mark the times at which the hashtag under consideration was used.
The inset bar plots show the fraction of users who used the hashtag more than once during the selected time window.
Finally, in the bottom plot row we visualize the content of tweets as word clouds.
Each word cloud contains the 50 most frequent words, with font sizes proportional to word frequencies.
The patterns displayed by these hashtags are representatives of the four classes of activity peaks found in our analysis.
The possibility of classifying online popularity peaks in a few discrete classes has been discussed in the literature [7,

to the di erent shapes or functional forms of the increasing and decreasing parts of the popularity pro les.
The origin of these few classes has been linked in the literature to two mechanisms that, to some extent, are present in most online social systems: endogenous propagation of information over the social network, and the injection into the system of information from exogenous online or o ine sources.
This scenario was tested for the evolution of popularity of YouTube videos [7, 8] and has also been discussed for trending topics or memes in Twitter [10, 12, 9].
The lack of a clear distinction between endogenous and exogenous information  ow in Twitter means that the number of classes, the possible functional shapes of the popularity pro les, and even the importance of the endogenous/exogenous distinction are all far from clear [9].
Here we take a di erent approach and attempt to simplify the possible scenarios by shifting emphasis from the detailed time series of popularity to coarse-grained information on the balance of activity before, during, and after the popularity peak.
To achieve this, for each hashtag exhibiting a popularity peak we summarize the hashtag usage timeline with the triple (fb, fp, fa) of the fractions of tweets posted before (fb), during (fp) and after the peak (fa).
By de -nition these fractions satisfy fb + fp + fa = 1.
We restrict the computation to a two-week period centered on the peak time, as shown in the examples of Fig. 1.
We identify hashtag clusters in the (fb, fa) space of independent parameters using a standard implementation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [38, 39] to learn an optimal Gaussian mixture model.
The number of components (clusters) of the mixture is set by using the Bayesian Information Criterion, as well as by means of a 10-fold cross-validation, yielding in both cases the 4 clus- ters shown in Fig 2.
The clusters are robust with respect to the initial conditions and parameters of the EM algorithms #winnenden #watchmen #nsotu

 Figure 1: Activity associated with four hashtags that exhibit a popularity peak: daily activity over time (top row), individual user activity (middle) row, and word clouds of tweet content (bottom row).
(provided that care is taken to deal with the points on the fb = 0 axis): 77% of the hashtags have a classi cation accuracy below 5%, and only 6% of them have a classi cation accuracy in excess of 20%.
Figure 3 shows the identi ed clusters in the 3-simplex (fb, fp, fa).
The marker representing each of the 115 selected hashtag is colored and shaped according to the group it has been classi ed into.
The hatched area is the parametric space excluded by the constraint that hashtags should have a peak-day activity of at least 10 times the baseline daily activity (i.e., the excluded parametric space is due to our selection of hashtags that exhibit a peak in their activity timeline).
The four groups of Fig. 3 correspond to di erent temporal patterns of collective attention, as illustrated below in relation to the hashtags of Fig. 1.
(cid:129) Activity concentrated before and during the peak (orange triangles).
These hashtags correspond, by definition, to anticipatory behavior, with users posting increasing amount of content as the date of the event approaches, followed by a sharp drop in attention right after the event.
See for example the hashtag #masters (underlined in the  gure) which was used to discuss the 2009 Golf Masters.
(cid:129) Activity concentrated during and after the peak (purple circles).
In this class we  nd hashtags indicating unexpected events that make an impact, such as the #winnenden school shooting.
The sudden onset of activity is a reaction to the unexpected event, and it is likely to be driven by exogenous sources such as communication in mass media.
(cid:129) Activity concentrated symmetrically around the peak (red squares).
These hashtags have neither the purely anticipatory nor the purely reactive behaviors illustrated above, and this may indicate a mix of exogenous and endogenous factors building up collective attention to a peak intensity, as a speci c day approaches, and then away from it as user attention shifts away.
See for example the case of the hashtag #watchmen, used to discuss a blockbuster movie.
The peak occurs on the day of the movie release in theatres.
(cid:129) Activity almost totally concentrated on the single day of the peak (green rounded square).
These hashtags correspond to transient collective attention associated with events that are highly discussed only while they happen, such as the 2009 State of The Union address (#nsotu), or the transient large-scale malfunctions of widely used Google services (#gfail).
These patterns are somehow expected, in the sense that these are the only possibilities for the coarse-grained temporal pro le of a hashtag with a popularity peak.
However, the existence of well de ned hashtag clusters, as well as their stability, are far from trivial and indicate that coarse grain-ing the temporal dynamics of collective attention as shown here can expose robust indicators of the social semantics associated with hashtags.
The presence of clearly separated clusters may also be deeply linked to the diverse nature of the mechanisms driving popularity in online social systems.
Details on the usage and origin of the hashtags shown in Fig. 3 are available in Appendix A.
The examples discussed above, such as those of Fig. 1, point to important di erences in the social semantics of the di erent classes of hashtags.

aspect, we systematically analyze the content of the tweets associated with each group of hashtags, using the semantic grounding described in Section 3.3.
WordNet provides hierarchical structures of concepts that can be made into a single directed acyclic graph by adding a root  entity  node as parent of the WordNet taxonomies.
Thus, Wordnet can be used to coarse-grain the semantics of the looked-up terms by focusing on a given (high enough) level of the subsump-tion hierarchy.
Our interest here is to provide a semantic  ngerprint of the content associated with the di erent hashtag classes, in order to expose di erences in their social semantics.
The concepts at depth 4 of the WordNet hierarchy were identi ed as appropriate for this purpose, as that hierarchical level provides a good enough semantic diversity while featuring a small number of generic subsuming categories.
We restricted our analysis to the concepts at depth 4 that occur most frequently in the text associated with the hashtags under study: the right-hand side of Fig. 4 lists the
 that are subsumed by them.
To expose the semantic di erences between hashtag classes we proceed as follows: For each hashtag we compute a normalized feature vector of the frequencies of occurrence of the selected WordNet concepts.
We then average this vector over all hashtag belonging to a given class and obtain the class feature vectors of Fig. 4, where the radius of discs is proportional to the normalized frequency of the corresponding concept in a given class of hashtags.
Clearly, different dynamic classes correspond to di erent semantics of the corresponding tweets.
The content of hashtags with activity concentrated before the peak has a stronger prevalence of concepts like  social events  and  time period  (e.g., easter), consistent with the social anticipation of a known event.
Conversely, hashtags whose activity is concentrated after the peak, usually associated to unexpected events, include several marketing campaigns such as macheist, and this is re ected in the prevalence of concepts like  free  and  evidence .
Tags with the activity concentrated mostly on the peak day correspond to events that attract the users  attention for short periods of time, such as sport events and media events (e.g., concepts associated with oscar, subsumed by the  symbol  concept).
The detailed annotations of Appendix A allow to make contact between speci c hashtags or hashtag classes and the information of Figs.
3 and
 activity pro les may open the door to content tagging techniques based on popularity dynamics and on other behavioral cues.
Having identi ed classes of popular hashtags that di er in activity pro les and semantics, we now turn to investigating whether such classes are also associated with distinct patterns of information propagation.
Similarly to the approach of Ref.
[7], we regard information spreading as an epidemic process, where the behavior of using a given hashtag spreads from one user to another.
The relevant social network for this epidemic process is Twitter s follower network : whenever a user posts a given hashtag, her followers are exposed to the hashtag and can decide to adopt it in turn.

Figure 4: Semantic makeup of the hashtag classes: columns represent peak types and rows correspond to topics, i.e., concepts in the WordNet semantic lexicon.
The radius of a circle is proportional to the average normalized frequency of the topic in the corresponding hashtag class.
The displayed topics represent the most frequently observed generic concepts.
Sample terms subsumed by them are reported in parenthesis.
users can also start using the hashtag spontaneously, as a result of exposure to external events (elections, sport matches, disasters, etc.)
or to exogenous information sources.
The  rst feature we analyze is the fraction of retweets to total tweets in the messages associated with each hashtag under study.
Retweets are forwarding actions in which a tweet from a followed user is delivered to one s followers together with a reference to the source.
Because of their nature, retweets have been investigated as a mechanism for information di usion in Twitter [23].
The fraction of retweets is an indicator of how many (forwarded) copies are present in the tweets associated with a hashtag, and provides information on the spreading attitude of the corresponding topic.
Retweets were identi ed both by checking for an initial  RT  marker or through tweet metadata.

panel of Figure 5 reports the fraction of retweets for the four hashtag classes.
A box plot is used to provide information on the dispersion of parameter values inside each hashtag class.
Hashtags with the activity distributed symmetrically around the peak or concentrated at the peak day have a higher fraction of retweets.
This supports the idea that those hashtags are associated with a higher level of endogenous activity, similarly to what happens for some YouTube videos [7].
Conversely, hashtags characterized by activity before the peak are associated to anticipatory behaviors and appear less prone to viral spreading.
The box-plot in the top-right panel of Fig. 5 reports the fraction   of users who adopt the hashtag when none of the users they follow have used it before.
In other words,   estimates the fraction of  seeders  that inject the information related to the hashtag into the social network.
Although the level of heterogeneity inside the four groups is high, we see that the hashtags with activity concentrated after the peak tend to have more seeders.
This indicates that the propagation is probably fueled by exogenous factors, such as publicity campaigns or mass media communication.
A further corroboration is provided by the semantic analysis of Fig. 4, as these hashtags contain concepts such as  sign  (sign-up for a service) ,  account  (create an account) or  free  that are usually associated with commercial campaigns that are heavily di used in traditional media.
The box-plot in the bottom-left panel of Fig. 5 reports the average fraction   of a user s followers who adopt the hashtag after he or she has posted a tweet containing it.
In modeling epidemic processes,   is a measure of infectiousness.
In this context, it bears information about the capacity of a behavior or meme to propagate from a user to her followers.
The box-plot shows that   does not depend strongly on the hashtag class and its median value is about
 the Twitter social network independently of the content or popularity pro le of the hashtags.
The estimation of both   and   depends on the sampling of the social network at hand.
However, an analysis made using sub-samplings of the follower network obtained by cutting edges has showed that   is relatively stable to the level of sampling, while   is more sensitive.
Nevertheless, since our sampling of the network is  xed it is legitimate to compare the results obtained for di erent hashtags even in the case of  .
Finally, in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 5 we report the average time   , in hours, between the  rst tweet and the last tweet with the same hashtag posted by each user (we set   = 0 for those users who post the hashtag only once).
That is,   indicates the time during which users are likely to spread their use of the hashtag to followers.
The four hashtags classes display similar values of   except for the case of activity concentrated on the peak day.
In that case, hashtags have the lowest   value, since activity is concentrated in a small period of time corresponding, for example, to a short-term disruption of online services.
In summary, we performed an extensive analysis of the Twitter hashtags that exhibit a popularity peak.
Previous work found that popularity peaks in online systems can be clustered in a few prototypical classes according to the temporal features of their popularity dynamics.
Here we introduce a simple way of coarse-graining the temporal usage patterns of hashtags that exposes discrete dynamical classes.
The clusters we  nd correspond to the four possible ways of distributing the hashtag activity with respect to the day of peak usage.
Clusters are well de ned and the classi cation of hashtags is stable with respect to small perturbations.
We ground in a semantic lexicon the contents of tweets associated with popular hashtags, and  nd insightful correlations between the class a hashtag belongs to and the (social) semantics of the associated content.
In particular, hashtags that are mostly active before reaching a peak usually deal with scheduled social events or speci c moments in time, indicating an anticipatory collective behavior.
Hashtag with symmetric activity patterns across the peak seem to be associated with endogenous propagation over the social network.
Hashtags that only exhibit a tail of activity after the peak correspond to unexpected events or exogenous driving.
Furthermore, we measure standard parameters of epidemic propagation over the online social network and relate these parameter values to the di erent hashtag classes, to unveil patterns of injection or propagation of information.
The balance between internal propagation (endogenous) and external injection of information was assumed so far to be the main explanation for the existence of di erent clusters of online popular events.
Our results indicate that the content type is also very important.
For instance, the hashtags used to discuss the  swine  u  pandemic (top of Fig. simplex) or a popular event such as the Oscars ceremony (bottom-left of the simplex) show markedly di erent popularity pro les despite the fact that both attract a high level of attention from the media.
Both hashtags display high levels of external seeding, as well as relatively low levels of endogenous propagation.
Thus, the di erent social semantics of these hashtags is likely the cause underlying the observed di er-ences in activity dynamics.
We remark that a robust classi cation into dynamical classes of user attention was obtained by using very simple parameters computed on time series of daily popularity.
Contrary to other methods, which require the estimation of power-law exponents for popularity growth, or the computation of expensive correlations between high-resolution activity time series, the parameters introduced here can be easily computed in a scalable way.
While they lack predictive power, as they need a record of past activity to be computed, they can support the discovery of speci c behavioral patterns in large-scale records of user activity.
The robustness of the proposed approach, if con rmed in other settings, could support implicit temporal tagging of the Twitter data stream, where   for example   anticipatory behavior associated to a given date points to that date as a focus of collective expectation.
The speci c semantics that can be linked to a given temporal pro le may be used to mine collective attention in order to construct implicit annotations of time-lines on the basis of social media streams.
Of course, this requires an extensive work of validation that falls outside the scope of the present work.
Progress in this direction will requires more re ned content analysis by means of natural language processing and sentiment analysis, as well as validation in user studies or crowd-sourced settings.
