Recently, microblogging sites such as Twitter have rapidly grown from yet another social networking service into one of the most prevalent type of social media.
According to a recent statistic [36], Twitter has accumulated over 200 million users as well as hundreds of billions of short messages (i.e., tweets).
Due to the convenience of posting short messages, thousands of tweets are posted every second and from every corner of the world, assembling the  SMS of the internet  [9] and the collection of  global conversations  [13].

Hashtag, as a brand-new organizational object of information, has emerged from this context and soon become widely adopted by Twitter users to facilitate their navigation in this deluge of information.
Figure 1 presents two examples of hashtags and the results of searching the two hashtags in Twitter.
As simple as a user-composed keyword starting with the # symbol, a hashtag e ectively coordinates relevant tweets and people in the microblogging media.
The use of hashtags has brought convenience to Twitter users in various ways.
As a user-de ned index term of content, a hashtag links relevant topics and events together [8], making it much easier to assess the semantics of a tweet.
As a result, the exposure of tweets containing certain hashtags are maximized in information retrieval and navigation.
For example, tweets related to iPhone are easily retrieved by a single click on the hashtag #iphone (see the left panel of Figure 1 (a)).
To this end, a hashtag plays the role of a social bookmark: annotating the content, being shared to other users, and assembling the folksonomy.
Is this the only role of a hashtag?
Sociologists, media observers, and computer scientists have all noticed another role.
Beyond a bookmark of content, a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community [34, 11, 12, 28].
Indeed, a hashtag enables users to identify and participate in online chats designated by the tag [34].
Birds of a feather can be easily found and connected by tracking a particular hashtag, as shown in the right panel of Figure 1.
To this end, a hashtag de- nes a virtual community of users with the same background (e.g.,  #Umich ), the same interest (e.g.,  #iPhone ), or involved in the same conversation or task (e.g.,  #www2012 ,  #VoteForObama ).
A user joins such a community by simply including that hashtag in her own tweets.
hypothesis that when posting a hashtag, the Twitter users are aware of the dual role it plays   as a unique indicator of both the topic of the content and the membership of a community [25, 15].
In other words, by creating a hashtag, a user either invents and shares a new bookmark (of content), or initializes and spreads a coat of arm (of a community), or both.
By adopting an existing hashtag, a user either presents her interest in a topic, or presents her intent to obtain a community membership, or both.
Should this hypothesis hold, one would expect the analysis of hashtags contribute signi cantly to the understanding of user interests and behaviors in microblogging sites.
Interestingly, even before being formally tested, this hypothesis has already been directly or indirectly leveraged in various studies of microblogging.
Indeed, in existing literature, hashtags have been e ectively utilized as critical features for various tasks of text or social network analysis, including topic detection and tracking [3], text classi cation [30], community identi cation [24], and link prediction [35], etc.
On one hand, hashtags do perform e ectively in most of these tasks as a speci c type of features.
On the other hand, because of the lack of a formal conclusion on the role of hashtags, it is di cult to explain why the involvement of hashtags works in some tasks but not in others.
There s little insight on how to make the best use of hashtags.
In this work, we take the initiative to conduct a systematic empirical analysis of how the dual role of a hashtag a ects hashtag adoption.
Our goal is to formally test whether the content role and the community role a ect users  behavior of adopting hashtags that they have never used before.
To achieve this, we focus on how hashtags are adopted and used by Twitter users, and investigate whether this behavior can be explained as the behavior of bookmarking the content and/or the behavior of joining a community.
Should the hypothesis hold, the following observation would be expected: 1) the major factors that a ect the behavior of content tag ging and joining communities will also signi cantly a ect the adoption of hashtags; and 2) by carefully measuring the magnitude of these factors, it is feasible to make predictions of future adoption of hashtags.
The contribution of our work is not to investigate how to utilize hashtags to enhance particular data mining tasks.
Instead, our study provides a foundation of the rationality of using hashtags in these tasks: why it works; and in what context it might work better.
Accordingly, our goal is not to di erentiate the role of an individual hashtag, but to provide a macroscopical analysis of the two roles.
The predictive analysis in our work also serves as a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation, which provides insights to the future construction of recommender systems of hashtags.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
We start with a discussion of related work in Section 2.
In Section 3 we introduce comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of content tagging and joining communities, followed by a demonstrative analysis of how these measures correlate with the hashtag usage (Section 4).
A formal regression analysis is presented in Section 5 to test the predictive power of these measures to the adoption of hashtags.
In Section 6, we develop machine learning methods to predict the future adoption of hashtags of individual users, which serves as a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation.
We conclude our work in Section 7.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the  rst formal analysis to test the predictive power of the dual role of hashtags on hashtag adoption.
Between the two roles, the role of content tagging has connected hashtags to existing social tagging systems such as del.icio.us 1 and Flickr 2.
Those tags are also generated by the users to annotate content such as Web pages or photos and are being shared to other users.
The second role as the symbol of a community membership, on the other hand, has di erentiated hashtags from traditional social tags.
Playing this role, hashtags are employed as a mechanism to participate in online conversations [19] and join virtual communities [34, 12].
This role has been carefully examined in individual events such as scienti c conferences [22, 11].
Letierce et al. [22] concluded that annotating messages by hashtags reveals a strong desire from the users to join in the discussion related to the conference.
Ebner et al. [11] argued that conference communities in Twitter are built based on the adoption of one speci c hashtag.
Therefore, a hashtag is not only a tag of content but also the tag of a community.
The community role of a hashtag presents in its functionalities to identify a community, form a community, and allow users to join a community - a role never played by traditional social tags.
In general, social tags (such as those in del.icio.us, Ci-teULike, Flickr, Last.fm and YouTube) serve for two purposes [25, 15]: i) organizational, to facilitate description or navigation, and ii) social, to facilitate resource exposure and sharing.
This is quite di erent from the user s intent of joining a community, which presents the community role of a hashtag.
Because of the conversation nature of Twitter, the social interactions in Twitter communities are far more frequent than those in other social media.
In other words, a Twitter community started by hashtags has much richer inner-community communications, compared to a  at set of people who happen to use the same bookmark.
Our measurement of the factors of content tagging or joining communities has largely bene ted from existing literature.
The factors a ecting content tagging are inspired from the studies of traditional content tagging systems [25, 15], especially tag recommender systems [20, 14].
The factors of joining communities are inspired from the literature of social network analysis, in which this is modeled as a cascading behavior [1, 10], or the adoption of innovation [32, 5].
The predication analysis in our work is in general related to the prediction of user behavior in online communities [33,
 MovieLens is a ected by community in uence and evolving personal tendency such as preferences and beliefs about the tags they apply.
Heymann et al. [18] predicted tag usage in Del.icio.us based on page text, anchor text, surrounding hosts, and other tags for URLs.
Hecht et al. [17] predicted location information through users  tweets.
Finally, our work is also related to the recommender systems in microblogging communities, including the recommendation of followee [16], content [7] and conversations [6] in Twitter.
Our work presents a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation, instead of aiming at constructing a particular recommender system.
1http://www.delicious.com 2http://www. ickr.com Our fundamental hypothesis is that a hashtag plays the dual role of both the signature of the content and the symbol of a community membership.
Should it hold, the user s behavior of adopting a hashtag would be interpreted as either the behavior of bookmarking a content, or the behavior of adopting a community membership, or both.
In this section, we present comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of tag selection and joining communities.
We focus on the behavior of a Twitter user u to post a hashtag h at time t in one of his tweets d, which is a short document with a limit of 140 characters.
Adopting the common practice in information retrieval, we represent a tweet as a bag of words, i.e., d = {w1, ..., wN}.
We denote D as a large collection of tweets, U as a set of twitter users, and H as a set of hashtags.
Multiple types of relationships exist between Twitter users: a user u can follow another user v, become a friend (i.e., fol-lowee) of v, or mention v in one of his own tweets, or quote and redistribute one of v s tweets by retweeting it.
In our task, we particularly focus on the retweeting relationship.
Rather than the following-followee relationships, a retweet-ing relationship is a much stronger indicator of social in u-ence, which is a major driving force of cascading behavior in online communities [10].
Indeed, it has been proved in literature that while the number of followers sheerly represents a user s popularity, the following relationship reveals little about the social in uence of a user [4].
In contrast, the retweeting relationship, akin to the practice of forwarding interesting blog posts and links via email, can be understood as a form of adoption of innovation and di usion of information, and reveals salient aspects determining the in uence [4].
Networks of users can be constructed according to a spe-ci c type of relationship.
For example, a retweet network of users can be de ned as a directed graph Grt = (V, E), where every vertex u   V denotes a Twitter user and every directed edge (u, v)   E denotes that the user v has retweeted at least one tweet of the user u.
The direction of the edge (i.e., u   v) corresponds to the direction of information di usion.
An edge can be further weighted by rtu,v, the number of times that u was retweeted by v. The larger rtu,v is, the more frequently v has been in uenced by u.
For a user u, we then denote the set of users he has retweeted as Iu, corresponding to the in-links of u in Grt.
The set of users who have retweeted u is denoted as Ou, corresponding to the out-links of u.
Clearly, the behavior of users in Iu can directly in uence the behavior of u, while the behavior of u can directly in uence users in Ou.
Definition 1: Hashtag Adoption.
We de ne a hashtag h as used by a user u if it appears in one of her tweets.
We call a hashtag usage an  adoption  if an existing hashtag h is for the  rst time used by a user u in her tweet d. Thus we exclude the scenario that h is invented by u.
The adoption is spontaneous if the tweet d is composed by the user herself instead of by retweeting others.
The adoption of hashtags is the user behavior we focus on in this study.
Given a time-stamped collection of tweets D, a set of users U , and a retweeting network Grt, we now present formal measures to quantify the major factors of selecting a content tag and adopting a community membership.
We start with the role of a hashtag as an indicator of content.
A user uses a hashtag to characterize his interest, to annotate the topic of a tweet, and to share the content to his peers.
To this end the adoption of a hashtag is similar to the adoption of a bookmark in Del.icio.us, or a tag in Flickr, or a user-selected keyword in weblogs.
What factors a ect the user s selection of such a content tag?
How can they be measured?
Clues can be found from literature, especially from those about recommender systems of tags [14].
To summarize, a tag recommender system usually  lters tags by optimizing a number of objectives, closely corresponding to the major factors of how a user selects a tag.
These factors include: 1) the popularity of the tag; 2) the relevance to the content; and 3) the closeness to the user s personal preference.
While the popularity of a tag is easy to measure, the relevance objective is usually modeled by information retrieval methods such as adaptive  ltering [2].
The preference objective, on the other hand, is usually optimized using collaborative  ltering techniques (e.g., [31]).
Largely inspired by this body of existing literature, we discuss how to measure the two corresponding characteristics of a hashtag: the magnitude of relevance to the content and the closeness to the user preference.
Relevance We  rst measure the relevance between a hashtag and the content it annotates.
It is worth giving attention that there are two di erent scenarios in tag recommendation.
In some cases when the document to be annotated is known (e.g., suggesting bookmarks for a particular web page), the relevance is measured between the tag and the document.
In more other cases, the recommendation is made independent to a particular document (e.g., suggesting tags on the front-page of Delicious).
In such cases, the relevance is judged between the tag and a dynamic pro le of the user.
The user pro le is usually constructed by accumulating all historical content generated or consumed by the user.
Such a method is known as adaptive  ltering in information retrieval [2].
Note that the extremely sparse information in the tag string is usually ine ective in the assessment of relevance.
It is common practice to construct and use a rich representation of a tag based the context - all documents it annotated.
In our task, we adopt the intuition of adaptive  ltering by measuring the  user-level  relevance instead of a  tweet-level  relevance.
This is not only because a tweet is extremely short, but also because we care about whether a user will adopt a hashtag sometime in the future, instead of whether she will adopt a hashtag in a particular tweet.
This leads to the following family of measures: Definition 2: Relevance Measures.
The relevance between a hashtag h and a user u is measured by a similarity function of two pro les, sim(Dh, Du), where the hashtag pro le Dh integrates all tweets containing h and the user pro le Du consists of all tweets posted by u up to a given time point.
Preference We then measure how close a hashtag is tied to the per-plays a critical role in tag recommender systems [14].
Among all the tags relevant to the content, a user usually prefers the ones she has used before, or the ones that are similar to those she has used.
In the problem of hashtag adoption, we are interested in hashtags that have not been used by the user.
tivity of a community is either correlated to the popularity of the hashtag, or can be interpreted as a form of indirect social in uence, where the community members propagate their in uence through the inner-community links.
We focus on two essential factors of the adoption of community membership: prestige and in uence.
Definition 3: Preference Measures.
The degree to which a hashtag h is close to the personal preference of u is measured by an aggregate function f ( ) of the similarity between h and all hashtags ever used by u.
Let Hu be the set of hashtags u has ever used up to a given time point, a preference measure takes the form of f ({sim(h, h (cid:3)   Hu}).
(cid:3) )|h Note that the similarity between two hashtags is computed based on a richer pro le of two hashtags instead of the tag string.
The pro le is constructed using either all the tweets h appeared in, Dh, or all users who have used h, Uh.
Any reasonable aggregate function f ( ) introduces an instantiation of the preference measure, such as the maximum, minimum, sum, or a weighed average.
It is worth mentioning that while the relevance measure re ects the intuition behind many content  ltering services [2], the preference measures re ect the intuition behind a common approach to collaborative  ltering - to  rst establish the similarity among items, and then recommend items that are similar to the items already rated by the user [31].
Please also note that both the relevance and the preference are time-variant, as both the semantics of a hashtag and the personal interest/preference of a user change fast over time.
Hashtags also play a relatively implicit role as the symbol of a community membership.
While a user can also use traditional types of social tags such as Flickr tags to  nd people with similar interests, a community clearly di ers from a  at set of people by the rich interconnections among the members.
Indeed, we calculated the average level of interactions within a  hashtag community,  based on the number of retweets, replies, and mentions between community members.
The level of interaction is signi cantly higher than among random users.
Based on our computation, the network density of hashtag communities is around a thousand times larger than the network density among users using the same tag in Flickr, LiveJournal, or YouTube.
To this end, the user behavior of adopting a hashtag can be interpreted as the adoption of a community membership (i.e., to join a community).
In social network analysis, the behavior of joining a community is usually treated as an instantiation of information di usion or cascading behavior [10, 1], similar to the adoption of innovation [32, 5].
By adopting the membership of a community, the newcomer adopts the norm of the community.
Our second task is to quantify the major factors that a ect the behavior of joining communities.
We extract a summary of several factors from the literature investigating the adoption of community membership: 1) how large the community is; 2) how prestigious the community members are; 3) how much the user is in uenced by his friends already in the community; and 4) how actively the community members interact.
Apparently, the size of a  hashtag community  is highly correlated to the popularity of the hashtag.
The ac-Prestige We start with the measurement of the prestige of community members designated by a hashtag.
To do this, we  rst propose a way to measure the prestige of individual users.
The measurement of prestige is a classical problem in social network analysis, leading to many possible instantiations [10, 27].
Intuitively, if a user is followed/retweeted by many users, she appears to be more prestigious; she appears to be even more prestigious if her followers are prestigious.
In this work, we adopt the PageRank score [29], which has been proven to be a robust measure of prestige.
Similar to the context of ranking Web pages or scienti c papers, PageR-ank of Twitter users can be computed based on either the following/followee graph or the retweet graph.
We believe the retweet network is a better choice because retweeting implies an endorsement of another user s content, similar to linking to a Web page or citing a scienti c article.
Definition 4: Prestige Measures.
Let Uh be a hashtag community, essentially a set of users who have used the hashtag h. The prestige of a hashtag community is measured by the result of an aggregate function of the prestige score of each existing member of the hashtag community, f ({pu|u   Uh}).
pu is realized as the PageR-ank score of the vertex u in the retweet network Grt.
Once again, any reasonable aggregate function f ( ) introduces an instantiation of the prestige measure.
In uence We then propose measures for the social in uence, also known as the  neighborhood e ect.  If many of my friends have adopted an innovation, or have joined a community, so will I [1].
To measure this e ect, a critical issue is how to identify the  neighborhood,  or the people who have an in uence on the behavior of the user.
Once again, we prefer to utilize the retweeting relationship instead of the follow-ing/followee relations.
This is because a retweeting behavior provides a much stronger indication of cascading behavior and social in uence.
We quantify the social in uence of a hashtag community on a user by aggregating the in uence of its individual members on that user.
Di erent realizations of individual in u-ence de ne di erent instantiations of the in uence measure.
Definition 5: Influence Measures.
Let Uh be a hashtag community, essentially the set of users who have used hashtag h. The magnitude of in uence Uh has on a user u is de ned as a function of the in uence of individual users v   Uh on user u given the retweet network structure Grt, g({s(v, u)|v   Uh}, Grt).
The strength of in uence of a single user v on u, s(v, u), is either realized as a constant if v   Iu and zero otherwise, or proportional to the prestige of v, or proportional to the frequency that u has retweeted v s tweets, rtv,u (as a surrogate of the frequency that v has in uenced u before), etc.
gregate function of all the individual in uences s(v, u).
In this case, the inference measure excludes the e ect of the community members who are not u s direct in-neighbors.
A more general realization of g( ) propagates the in uence of each community member through her out-neighbors to the whole retweet network.
In other words, the in uence of a particular user and a community of users is now  smoothed  on the retweet network Grt.
Such a measure also re ects the inner-connectivity of a hashtag community.
Like relevance and preference, prestige and in uence measures are also time-variant because the retweeting behaviors change frequently over time.
Our discussion has been focused on factors of tagging content and joining communities, namely relevance, preference, prestige, and in uence.
Each of the four factors can be instantiated as a family of various measures, according to the particular selection of functions.
Beside these four, we are aware of many other potential factors of hashtag adoption.
They characterize either the property of the hashtag (e.g., the popularity of the hashtag), or the user (e.g., whether she has been actively posting), or the community de ned by the hashtag (e.g., the size of the community).
In fact, some of these factors, such as the popularity of hashtag and the size of the hashtag community, are highly correlated (with a correlation higher than 0.9).
Not surprisingly, the number of people adopting a hashtag is highly correlated to the number of times the hashtag is used.
Factors like these may be highly correlated to the behavior of hashtag adoption.
The pure analysis of only these factors, however, will not directly help us identify the two roles of the hashtag.
They are either correlated with both roles, or neither of them.
Nevertheless, these factors should still be included in our analysis, in order to comprehensively understand the e ect of the content-speci c and community-speci c factors in the context of hashtag adoption.
Below we present a broader range of measures that are likely to predict the adoption of hashtags but not relevant to testing the dual role: Popularity: the number of times a hashtag has been posted; or the number of users who adopted the hashtag.
Length: the number of characters in the hashtag string.
Freshness: the age of a hashtag, or the length of period since its  rst burst.
Degree: the number of people a user has retweeted or been retweeted by.
Activeness: the frequency or the ratio of tweets, retweets, and hashtags a user has posted in the past.
We refer to these measures as role-unspeci c measures, which would provide a baseline prediction model not spe-ci c to either of the roles.
Together with the four families of content and community speci c measures (role-speci c features), these general measures will be instantiated in Section 4 and used in the regression and prediction analysis.
We have introduced formal measures to quantify role-speci c factors of hashtag adoption, including the relevance, preference, prestige, and in uence.
Do the measures make sense?
Are these factors truly correlated with the use of hashtags?
As a proof of concept, we  rst conduct a straightforward exploratory analysis to demonstrate the correlation between each of the factors and the user behavior of hashtag usage.
We start with an introduction of the datasets and the speci c instantiations of the measures used in our analysis.
Two real world datasets are collected from Twitter.com, corresponding to two di erent sampling strategies.
The  rst dataset collects all the tweets posted by a sample of political users between March 25th 2007 to December
 sists of House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates during the midterm elections in the United States (i.e., year 2010).
The twitter accounts of these candidates are matched by querying Google with the names of the candidates and keyword  Twitter.  Then a manual process is applied to inspect and  lter the top 3 results so that only the Twitter accounts operated by the candidates or their sta  are kept in the collection.
Di erent from [24], we do not further  lter the set of users according to their activity level.
Hence, the dataset, notated as the Politics dataset, contains 373, 439 tweets and 9, 343 hashtags posted by 1, 029 users.
The second dataset is constructed from a random sample of tweets at a much larger scale.
This sample is drawn from a roughly 5% sampled stream of tweets between June
 the Stream dataset, includes roughly 19 million users, 49 million unique hashtags, and 476 million tweets.
Given a time period  , a user u, and a hashtag h which was created before  , we construct a user-hashtag pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5).
We then use the hashtag usage, i.e., the number of times h is used by u during  , to surrogate the level of interest of the user on the hashtag.
If h hasn t been used by u during and before  , the level of interest will be set to zero.
Instantiation of Measures We now present all the particular instantiations of the general measures proposed in Section 3.
These instances are used in the explanatory analysis to demonstrate their correlation to hashtag usage.
They will also be used as independent variables in the regression and features in the prediction model to predict hashtag adoption.
Note that most of the measures, including the the four role-speci c measures, are sensitive to time.
In our analysis, we carefully select time windows of various lengths to instantiate these measures.
We introduce additional notations related to the selection of time windows:   as a time window, n  u,h as the frequency u uses h during  , nr  u,h as the frequency of hashtag usage in retweets, and D  u,h as set of tweets containing h that are posted by u during  .
Table 1 summarizes all features instantiated from both the role-unspeci c measures (i.e., baseline features) and the four role-speci c measures.
Please note that the similarity of two hashtags is computed based on either the tweets or the users using the hashtags, instead of based on the hashtag strings.
Now that we have the particular instantiations of the adoption behavior and the features according to the role-speci c factors, we present a simple correlation analysis to demonstrate the relationship between these role-speci c factors and a user s degree of interests in a hashtag (surrogated by the frequency of using a hashtag).

We then collected all hashtags tweeted by these 30,106 users during this period, from which we obtained 269,712 user-hashtag pairs.
We then obtained 40,427 user-hashtag pairs from the Politics dataset between August 1st and October 30th 2010.
Note that identical time window is used to calculate the hashtag usage and the features.
To make it easier to visualize, we bin the values of each feature into buckets, so that each bucket contains the same number of user-hashtag pairs.
The plots in Figure 2 present the correlation between the degree of interest in a hashtag and the role-speci c factors.
Not surprisingly, the degree of interest of a user in a hashtag highly correlates with all four factors: relevance to the content, personal preference of the user, community prestige, as well as social in uence.
Intuitively, this suggests that the factors of selecting a content tag and the factors of joining a community are both a ecting the behavior of using a hashtag.
The result of this demonstrative analysis looks promising.
However, the simple correlation analysis does not provide evidence on whether these factors have the predictive power of the adoption of a hashtag, or whether they would make a joint e ect in reality.
To draw convincing conclusions, we proceed with a formal regression analysis.
Beyond the intuitively promising results from the correlation analysis, we are looking for formal evidences on 1) whether each of the proposed measures has a predictive power of hashtag adoption; 2) if yes, how signi cant the e ect is; and 3) whether the e ect remains signi cant when the factors interplay with each other.
We thus conduct a regression analysis with the hashtag adoption behavior as the response (dependent) variable.
Three groups of users are constructed from our two datasets:
 namely the Politics group;
 dataset, namely the Movie group;
 dataset, namely the Random group.
We formulate the regression analysis such that the dependent variable corresponds to whether or not a user will adopt a hashtag in a time period in the future.
The independent variables correspond to particular instantiations of the measures in Section 3, either role-speci c or role-unspeci c.
Since it is impossible to observe future events, we hold out the observations from a time window of 10 days,  1, to surrogate the hashtag adoption behaviors in the future.
Values of all independent variables are computed only based on the observations in a time period  0 prior to  1.
We prepare the data of our regression analysis as follows:
 either the complete set of users or a sample of users, all of which have been using hashtags recently (i.e., within 10 days prior to the held-out period  1).
The sampling process will be discussed in the next subsection.
posted by u in the held-out period  1 (i.e., in the  future ) but have not appeared in any tweet of u before  1.
These hashtags are  adopted  by the user in the held-out period.
Every such pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5) is formatted as a data point in the regression analysis, with the outcome variable set to 1.
hashtags from up to 10 days prior to  1, which have not been used by u in either  1 or ever before.
These hashtags are representatives of those that exist but are not adopted by the user.
Every such pair (cid:4)u, h(cid:5) is also formatted as a data point, with the outcome variable set to 0.
In the regression analysis, we use 10 days between November 11th 2009 and November 20th 2009 as the held-out period  1 for the Movie and the Random group.
For the Politics group, we partition the period between August 1st and October 30th 2010 into nine equivalent time windows and employed each of them as a held-out period.
The length of each held-out period Delta1 is thus also 10 days.
For all data points sampled through the above procedure, we compute the values of all the independent variables (i.e., one particular instantiation for each role-speci c or role-unspeci c measure) based on all the tweets posted within 30 days before  1 and the snapshot of the retweet network right before  1.
In other words,  0 is designed as the 30-day time window prior to  1, with respect to each particular realization of  1.
Below we provide more details on how the users and user-hashtag pairs are sampled.
Sample Users The  rst task of data preparation is to select the set of users from a given dataset.
As for the Politics dataset, we simply select all users who have used at least one hashtag within 10 days before the held-out period  1, representing active hashtag users.
For the Stream dataset, however, it is computationally costly to run the analysis on all the 17 million users.
We thus apply the following two sampling frames: an interest-based sample and a random sample.
Interest-based sampling Our  rst sampling frame targets at users with a focused aspect of interest.
We chose  movie  as our target aspect because i) many trending topics are related to movies according to the  Top Twitter Topics  by Mashable3, and ii) people discuss a lot on movie related topics in real life.
In particular, we select the set of users from the Stream dataset using the following snowball sampling procedure:
 lection of the Stream dataset.
in category  movies  as seeding users.
lect all the  rst-order and second-order neighbors of the seedling users.
With such a process, we have selected users who have either retweeted the three seedling users, or have retweeted another user who have retweeted them.
Combing the seedling users, their  rst-order and second-order out-neighbors, a pool of 178,323 Twitter users is constructed.
A further process selects a set of users who have posted at least one hashtag within 10 days before  1.

(b) The POLITICS dataset Figure 2: The degree of interest in hashtags correlates to the role-speci c factors.
the end, we obtain 8,029 users for this group, and we name the group as the Movie group.
Random sampling Another sampling strategy is to randomly select users from the entire dataset.
We gather all users that appear in the Stream dataset, and randomly select a set of users who have posted at least one hashtag within 10 days prior to  1.
In the end, we collected 15,038 users for this group, which is named as the Random group.
Sample Negative Examples Given a set of users, it is straightforward to generate data points (i.e., user-hashtag pairs) with a positive outcome of hashtag adoption.
The data points with a negative outcome (i.e., the event that a hashtag is not adopted), however, is trickier.
The simplest way is to create a negative example for each existing hashtag (i.e., within 10 days before the held-out period  1) that a user did not use during  1.
However, the massive number of hashtags simply makes the negative examples dominating the collection, diluting all useful signal.
Thus, for each user, we randomly sample negative examples proportional to the number of positive examples (i.e., number of hashtags adopted by this user).
We employ logistic regression to predict the adoption of hashtags in the held-out time period  1 from features computed based on  0 prior to  1.
One instantiation of each measure is included.
We set the time window  0 as the period of 30 days prior to  1.
To comprehensively understand the predictive power of the role-speci c measures, we also incorporate baseline features into the regression analysis.
Table 2 presents the results of the regression analysis.
Apparently, all the four role-speci c measures have a sig-ni cant and positive predictive power of hashtag adoption, even when merged together with all baseline measures.
One baseline measure, the variable Popularity in the Movie and Random group, yields a negative coe cient in the regression.
This is because the popularity of a hashtag is highly correlated with the sum of prestige of hashtag users (e.g., with a correlation over 0.9196 in the Movie group).
However, such correlation in the Politics group is lower, thus yielding a positive coe cient for Popularity.
Indeed, when we remove the Prestige variable from the regression, the co-e cient of Popularity becomes positive in the two groups (and remain signi cant).
The Length of hashtags presents a negative relationship with hashtag adoption, possibly because people tend to adopt short and concise hashtags.
The results of the regression analysis thus provide a much stronger evidence that both the content role and the community role a ect hashtag adoption.
All four role-speci c factors we presented have a signi cant positive predictive power to the adoption of hashtags.
The regression analysis has proved that all the role-speci c measures are predictive to the adoption of hashtags.
This reassures our hypothesis that the dual role of a hashtag affects the adoption.
We are, however, moving forward to investigate the feasibility of constructing an e ective prediction and recommender systems.
Unfortunately, the regression analysis doesn t tell how an e ective prediction system can be constructed based on these measures, or how hashtag recommendation can be done.
To test the feasibility of hashtag recommendation, we proceed with building a machine learning model to predict the adoption of new hashtags in the future.
Compared to the regression analysis that serves as a white box to interpret the e ect of the measures, this analysis provides a black box that aims at optimizing the accuracy of of predictions.

: Prestige Consistent to the regression analysis, we setup three experiments over three groups of users, and sample negative examples accordingly.
Held-out time periods are employed to surrogate the  future.  The prediction problem is cast as a binary classi cation task: whether or not a user will adopt a new hashtag in a held-out period.
The performance of such a classi er is evaluated by the accuracy of the predicted classes.
Strictly, the behavior of a user to adopt a hashtag in her own tweets is quite di erent from adopting a hashtag by retweeting others.
The former is spontaneous and the latter is passive.
We further di erentiate the tasks of predicting hashtag adoption in all tweets, retweets, and user-composed tweets (i.e., non-retweets) respectively.
Di erent from the regression analysis, we train the prediction model with a training dataset and assess the e ec-tiveness with a separate test dataset.
To do this, we select di erent pairs of  history  ( 0) and  future  ( 1) time windows.
We then use some  history-future  pairs to train the prediction model, and use other time window pairs to test the model.
From each pair of time windows, we sample a collection of user-hashtag pairs as data examples.
For each data example, we then compute all the features in Table 1 based on  0, and identify the label (positive or negative) based on whether the hashtag is adopted by the user during  1.
The number of positive and negative samples in our training and test datasets are presented in Table 3.
We  rst employ an SVM classi er with all baseline features in Table 1.
The RBF kernel is adopted, and 5-fold cross-validation is used to select parameters.
The performance of the SVM predictor is presented in Table 4.
Such a baseline model performs reasonably well - with 68% accuracy on the Politics group and around 75% on both the Movie group and the Random group, comparing to a 50% accuracy of random guess.
We then add the all features instantiating each of the four role-speci c measures into the classi er, to test the four families of measures one by one, and then altogether.
The inclusion of each of the four families of measures has improved the prediction performance signi cantly, with a few exceptions of the Prestige measures.
In all three groups, the mixture of all four families of features has further improved the prediction accuracy.
The only exception is the prestige measure on the Movie and Random group.
Surprisingly, the inclusion of the prestige measure even decreases the prediction performance when all tweets are considered.
While on the Politics group, the prestige features performed signi cantly well.
This is possibly due to the way prestige is computed.
Of both the Movie group and the Random group, prestige is computed based on the global retweet network of millions of users, most of which are not part of the group.
Therefore, the prestige is global and unspeci c to the community of the group.
Of the Politics group, however, the retweet network is speci c to the community.
The prestige is thus relatively  localized  and more speci c to the user group [4].
Therefore, we further conducted an experiment to remove the prestige measures from the Movie and the Random group.
The accuracy of to 82.00%, and the accuracy over Random group increased from 84.03% to 84.35%.
Interestingly, predicting the hashtag adoption in retweets seems to be easier than predicting the behavior in spontaneous tweets (Movie and Random).
The exception is the Politics group, where the candidates prefer to tweet rather than to retweet (Table 3).
In general, it is reasonable that the prediction of content in retweets is easier than the prediction of spontaneous tweeting behavior.
With all features included, the best prediction model achieves an accuracy around 80% among all datasets.
This is a promising result, suggesting the feasibility of building effective recommender systems of hashtags in Twitter.
We presented a formal empirical analysis to test how the dual role of hashtags in Twitter a ects hashtag adoption.
Results of a correlation analysis, a regression analysis, and a prediction analysis all suggest that a hashtag serves as both a tag of content and a symbol of membership of a community.
The measures we propose to quantify the factors of tagging content or joining communities all present signi cant predictive power to the adoption of hashtags.
The prediction analysis using a SVM predictor provides a feasibility study of hashtag recommender systems, which suggests a promising future direction of research.
