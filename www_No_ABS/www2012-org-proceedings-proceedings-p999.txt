Crowdsourcing, where a problem or task is broadcast to a crowd of potential contributors for solution, is a rapidly growing online phenomenon being used in applications ranging from seeking solutions to challenging projects such as in Innocentive or TopCoder, all the way to crowdsourced content such as on online Q&A forums like Y!
Answers, Stack-Over ow or Quora.
The two key issues which arise in the context of crowdsourcing are quality  is the obtained solution or set of contributions of high quality?  as well as participation  there is a nonzero e ort or cost associated with making a contribution of any quality in a crowdsourc-ing environment which can be avoided by simply choosing to not participate, and indeed many sites have too little content.
In such a setting, the e ort an agent decides to exert will depend on how many other agents are likely to participate and how much e ort they will exert, since the amount of e ort necessary to obtain a particular reward depends both on the number and strength of competitors an agent faces.
Naturally, the level of e ort agents choose, and therefore the quality of the output created, depends on the incentives o ered to agents.
How should rewards be designed to incen-tivize high e ort, in a setting where entry is an endogenous, strategic choice?
We are motivated by two di erent kinds of questions that arise in the context of designing rewards for crowdsourced content, depending on the setting and the nature of the rewards.
The  rst is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content (UGC) based sites, such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOver ow.
Here, the mechanism designer, or site owner, has a choice about how many of the received contributions to display, i.e., how to reward the contributions with attention   he could choose to display all contributions for a particular task, or display only the best few, suppressing some of the poorer contributions.
What strategy improves the quality of the best contribution On the one hand, suppression should cause quality to rise, because the payo  to poor content falls; on the other hand, suppressing content also corresponds to decreasing the total reward paid out, which could decrease quality.
Is it a good idea, in a game-theoretic sense, to display all contributions?
The second question arises in settings where there is some  xed total available reward which can be distributed arbitrarily amongst the agents.
This happens, for example, in the setting of crowdsourcing contests with monetary rewards, where the principal posing the challenge or task o ers some  xed amount of money for obtaining the solution to the challenge.
Another instance is systems which reward agents with virtual points1.
(The distinction between this setting and attention rewards is that it is not possible to take away attention from the second position and add it to the  rst position since, to a  rst approximation, attention to the second spot comes from a subset of viewers providing attention to the  rst; so attention rewards cannot be arbitrarily redistributed across ranks.)
How can rewards be designed to improve the quality of contributions in settings with arbitrarily redistributable rewards, when entry is endogenous?
Our contributions.
We use a mechanism with monotone, rank-based rewards in a model with contributors who strategically choose both participation and quality to simultaneously capture a wide variety of crowdsourcing environments, ranging from conventional crowdsourcing contests with monetary rewards such as TopCoder, to crowd-sourced content such as in Q&A forums.
We  rst analyze the equilibria of such monotone rank-order mechanisms, and explicitly construct the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium for this mechanism ( 3).
We then use this construction, which explicitly gives us the equilibrium participation probability and distribution of qualities, to address the question of how to design rewards for each of the two settings previously mentioned.
We  rst show ( 4) that for attention rewards, the entire equilibrium distribution and therefore every increasing statistic, including the maximum and average quality (accounting for participation) improves when the rewards for every rank but the last are as high as possible: if there are n potential contributors, then the optimal mechanism sets the attention rewards for ranks 1 through n   1 to be the maximum possible, while the attention to the nth rank is curtailed to the cost of producing the lowest possible quality contribution (note here that k < n agents may participate, in which case only the rewards for ranks 1, .
.
.
, k are given out).
If this cost is low, this prescribes, roughly speaking, displaying all but the poorest contribution.
We next investigate redistribution of rewards ( 5).
Unlike in models with exogenous entry with a  xed number of participants, it is possible here to increase the expected number of participants by subsidizing entry, for example, by providing a small reward to all participants in addition to a large reward to the winner.
In models with exogenous entry, more participants lead to higher qualities, suggesting that subsidizing entry may be productive in this endogenous
 the total number of points awarded (so that just doubling the number of points awarded for all tasks has no e ect on incentives), the total number of points available to reward agents with is e ectively  xed as well.
entry setting as well.
Also, even if subsidizing entry (at the cost of paying less to the winner) were to reduce the equilibrium distribution from which each contributor chooses her quality, the expected value of the maximum quality could nonetheless increase when the number of contributors increases, since we have the maximum of a larger number of random variables.
However, we show that subsidizing entry does not improve the expected value of the maximum quality, although it may improve the expected value of the total contribution.
In fact, we show that free entry (corresponding to a winner-take-all contest) is dominated by taxing entry making all entrants pay a small fee, which is rebated to the winner along with whatever rewards were already assigned, can improve the expected quality of the outcome.
A number of proofs have been removed for want of space, and can be found in the full version of the paper [10].
Related work.
There is a growing literature on the optimal design of contests [14, 15, 13], as well as speci cally on the design of online crowdsourcing contests [1, 4, 3] and online procurement (e.g., [16]).
The most relevant of these to our work are the following.
[14] investigates the optimal structure of rewards when the objective is to maximize the sum of qualities of contributions, for concave, linear and convex costs; [15] also considers the objective of maximizing the highest quality contribution.
[1] studies the optimal design of crowdsourcing contests in a setting with agents with heterogeneous abilities and linear costs, when the objective is to maximize the sum of the top k qualities minus the total reward paid out to agents.
[3] study the design and approximation of optimal crowdsourcing contests modeled as all-pay auctions, again for agents with linear costs, and investigate the extent of wasted e ort compared to conventional procurement.
There is also a voluminous economics literature on contest design not focused on crowd-sourcing, see, for example, [2] and references therein.
The key di erence between this literature and our work is endogenous entry  all these papers assume some  xed number n of contestants who always participate (i.e., the cost of producing the lowest possible quality c(0) = 0), whereas whether to participate or not is an endogenous strategic choice in our model (i.e., we allow for c(0) > 0).
That endogenous participation may matter is foreshadowed by the auction literature, which is the basis for much of the modeling of crowdsourced content provision  auctions with endogenous entry are quite di erent than auctions with exogenous participation.
For instance, while posting monopoly reserve prices is always part of seller maximization in auction models with exogenous participation, a monopoly seller sets e cient reserve prices when participation is endogenous [12].
Endogenous entry makes a substantial di erence in the crowd-sourcing models for much the same reason  it is no longer possible to reduce the pro ts of the contributors, because those pro t levels are determined by the cost of entry.
Our results on the optimality of taxing in  5 are foreshadowed by Taylor [17] and Fullerton and McAfee [5], both of whom show, albeit in di erent settings, that free entry produces too much entry.
An additional, though less important, di erence with the literature on online crowdsourcing contests [1, 3] is that we allow general cost functions rather than restricting linear cost functions.
There is also a related literature on models with endogenous entry [12, 5, 17, 9, 7, 8], although largely outside the
 [17] studies a setting with agents who all have a common exogenous cost to participation, and draw the quality of their output from some distribution.
An agent s only strategic choice is whether or not to enter in each period of a possibly multi-period game.
In this model, [17]  nds that restricting entry with taxation is optimal.
The key di erence from our work, of course, is that quality is an endogenous choice in our model as opposed to an exogenous draw from a distribution.
[8] uses a very similar agent model to that in [17], but instead addresses the question of implementation of optimal outcomes  are contest structures where the highest quality contribution receives some high prize and all other contributions receive some low prize adequate to implement the optimal outcome achievable with nonstrategic agents?
We do not address the question of im-plementability of optimal outcomes, but rather ask how to improve equilibrium outcomes.
[9, 7] address the question of incentivizing high-quality user-generated content (UGC) in a game-theoretic framework with strategic agents and endogenous entry, a setting related to that of crowdsourced content.
However, [9, 7] focus on the performance of mechanisms in the limit of diverging rewards (as is the case with attention rewards in the context of very popular UGC sites such as Youtube or Slashdot), while our results address the case of  nite, or bounded, rewards, as is relevant in much of crowdsourcing.
We model a general social computing or crowdsourcing scenario as a game with rank-dependent rewards, i.e., a rank-order mechanism with reward ai for producing the ith best contribution, and focus on the e ect of the reward structure on the qualities of contributions produced by strategic agents in a single micromarket, such as one crowdsourcing contest or a question in a Q&A forum.
There is a micromarket with a pool of n agents, each of whom is a potential participant in this micromarket.
Each agent can choose whether to contribute or not, as well as the quality of the contribution she makes if she chooses to enter.
Agents make the decision of whether to participate strategically, i.e., entry is endogenous, and each agent that chooses to participate then chooses her level of e ort, modeled as the quality q of the output she produces, strategically to maximize her utility.
We next describe the utility of an agent.
The cost, or e ort, required to producing a contribution of quality q for each agent is c(q).
We will assume that c(q)   0 is some strictly increasing, continuously di eren-tiable function of q.
Although we do not need this assumption, it will be useful to imagine that c(0) > 0, i.e., there is a nonzero cost to producing a contribution, even one of the lowest possible quality.
This nonzero participation cost models, for example, the cost of reading and understanding the task for which contributions are being solicited, which can be avoided by simply choosing to not participate.
Since c(0) > 0, participation always has a strictly positive cost, whereas not participating at all incurs zero cost and produces zero bene t, and therefore has a net utility of 0.
Homogeneity.
Note that our model of costs assumes homogeneity amongst all potential contributors, corresponding to assuming that agents do not di er in their abilities, but simply in the amount of e ort that they choose to put in.
While there are indeed settings where potential contributors may di er widely in their abilities, there are also settings where it is e ort, rather than ability, which dominates the quality of the outcome produced (for example, writing a review for a product on Amazon, or producing an article for a crowdsourced-content based site such as Associated Content which requires exhaustively researching the topic rather than inherent expertise, fall in this category).
Also, in several settings, such as speci c topics or categories in Q&A forums like Quora or Stackover ow, the set of potential contributors may be self-selected to have rather similar abilities or expertise levels, and therefore have similar costs to producing a particular quality.
While the most complete model of the real world would allow for di erences in both ability and e ort, we choose here to focus on strategic choice of e ort, i.e., to focus on the strategic question faced by an agent of  how little e ort can I get away with? , since this is a reasonable  rst approximation in many settings relevant to crowdsourcing.
Mechanism G(a1, a2, .

, an).
Once agents have made their participation and quality choices, the mechanism observes the qualities qi produced by the agents who enter, and awards prizes ai to the participants in decreasing order of quality.
Speci cally, a mechanism G(a1, a2, .

, an) awards a prize of value ai to the entrant who produces the ith highest-quality contribution.
If more than one agent produces the same quality, the mechanism breaks ties randomly amongst these agents to obtain a strict rank order, and assigns rewards according to this order.
No prizes are awarded to agents who do not enter, and speci cally, if no agent participates, no prize is awarded.
We note here that we assume that qualities are perfectly observable, as in all the prior literature on contest design and crowdsourcing contests [14, 3, 4, 1]  since each task in a crowdsourcing environment is usually posed by some principal who can rank the contributions in decreasing order of quality (such as the person posting the task in a crowdsourcing contest or the asker in an online Q&A forum), this assumption is reasonable, particularly since G(a1, a2, .

We will focus throughout on monotone mechanisms, in which higher ranks receive higher rewards, and not all rewards are equal.

Solution concept.
We use the solution concept of a symmetric Nash equilibrium, since agents  payo  functions are symmetric in the parameters of the game.
In a symmetric strategy, each contributor participates with the same probability and follows the same strategy of quality choices conditional on participating.
We will denote a pair of participation probability and CDF that constitute a symmetric mixed strategy by (p, G(q)).
Definition 2.2.
A symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium (p, G(q)) is a probability p and a distribution G over qualities q such that when every agent enters with probability tional on entering, no agent can increase her expected utility by deviating from this strategy, i.e., by changing either the probability with which she participates or the distribution G from which she draws a quality.
We begin by analyzing the equilibria of the mechanism G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an), which we will then use to compare outcomes in di erent mechanisms.
We  rst prove the following simple lemma, which eliminates the possibility of  pure strategy  equilibria in which all participants choose the same quality.
Lemma 3.1.
There exists no symmetric equilibrium in the game G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) where all participants choose the same quality q conditional on entering when the cost c(q) is continuous.
Proof.
Let U (q) =(cid:80)n i=1 aiP r(i|q), where P r(i|q) is the probability of being ranked ith when choosing quality q, given that the remaining agents participate with probability p and draw qualities according to the distribution G(q) conditional on participating, and ties are broken at random.
U (q) is the bene t to this agent from entering with quality q when other agents play (p, G(q)).
The payo  to an agent who enters with quality q, when other agents play according to a mixed strategy (p, G(q)) in G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) is aiP r(i|q)   c(q).
 (q) = U (q)   c(q) = n(cid:88) i
 continuous on its support, i.e., it has no mass points.
Suppose not; let q0 be a mass point.
Then, since ties are broken randomly, note that lim  0 U (q0 + ) > U (q0), Proof.
Suppose there is a symmetric equilibrium in which all participants choose the same quality q conditional on entering.
If k agents enter (where k can be a random variable if participants randomized over the choice of entry), the expected payo  to each agent that enters (where i=1 ai/k.
So the expected payo  to an agent who enters with quality q is the expectation over all possible values of k, the expectation is over random tiebreaking) is (cid:80)k n(cid:88) k(cid:88)   c(q).
ai k E[U (q, q i)] = Pr(k) k=1 i=1 ai > ai+1 for some i, a1 > (cid:80)n But note that entering with quality q +  is a pro table deviation if all other agents who enter choose quality q: choosing q +  gives this agent a reward of a1 for all values of k. Since ai n (and Pr(n) > 0 in a symmetric equilibrium in which all participants enter with some positive probability).
Since c(q) is continuous, there exists a choice of  such that i=1 E[U (q + , q i)] > E[U (q, q i)] which constitutes a pro table deviation, contradicting the assumption that there is a symmetric equilibrium in which all agents choose the same quality.
Since there can exist no symmetric pure strategy equilib-ria in which all agents choose a single quality q  conditional on entering, we will investigate symmetric mixed strategy equilibria where all agents randomize over their choice of quality (conditional on entering) using the same distribution.
First, of course, we need to establish the existence of such symmetric mixed strategy equilibria  we will do this by explicitly constructing such an equilibrium.
The next theorem establishes some properties that any symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium to G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an), if one exists, must possess.
We will use these properties to prove the existence of a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium by constructing one in Theorem 3.2.
Theorem 3.1.
Let (p, G(q)) be any symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium to G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an).
If the agents  cost c(q) is continuous and strictly increasing in q, then G(q) is continuous, i.e., contains no mass points, and has support on an interval with left endpoint 0.
since there is a positive probability of a tie at q = q0, which can be eliminated by choosing a slightly higher quality.
This implies that there is an  such that the payo  from choosing q0 +  is strictly greater than that at q0, since the cost function c is continuous in q: (U (q0 + )   c(q0 + ))  (q0 + ) = lim  0 lim  0 > U (q0)   c(q0).
But this means q0 cannot belong to the support of an equilibrium distribution G, a contradiction.
So G(q) is continuous on its support.
ities in the support of G. Since G contains no mass points as shown above, G(qmin) = 0.
Suppose, for a contradiction, that qmin > 0.
But then, an agent can pro tably deviate by choosing qmin    instead of qmin: since G(qmin) = 0, an agent choosing qmin will be ranked lowest among all agents who enter anyway, i.e., U (qmin   ) = U (qmin).
But c(qmin) > c(qmin   ) since c(q) is strictly increasing, so  (qmin   ) >  (qmin), yielding a pro table deviation, contradicting qmin belonging to the support of an equilibrium distribution.
This argument holds for any quality strictly greater than the lowest quality, which is 0.
Therefore, any equilibrium distribution G must have qmin = 0.
of G(q) must be an interval (i.e., the support contains no  holes ), or equivalently, G(q) is strictly increasing between 0 and  q, where G( q) = 1.
Suppose not; then there must exist some q1 < q2 such that G(q1) = G(q2) (recall that we have already ruled out mass points, so speci cally, there can be no mass point at q2).
But then U (q1) = U (q2), since the quality q a ects the probability of being ranked in any particular position only via G(q) (see (1)).
So  (q2) = U (q2)   c(q2) < U (q1)   c(q1) =  (q1) since c(q1) < c(q2), a contradiction to q2 belonging to the support in equilibrium.

(cid:32) (cid:33) n   1 i   1 Note that this expression is valid only because G has no mass points, since if there is a mass point at q there is a positive probability of more than one agent using the same quality, which leads to ties that are broken randomly.

Now we will use Theorem 3.1 to construct, and therefore demonstrate the existence of a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium (p, G(q)) in G(a1, a2, .

There exists a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium (p, G(q)) to G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) when ai   ai+1 for all i; this equilibrium is unique up to inclusion of the endpoints of the support.
Proof.
We will construct a candidate pair (p, G(q)) for which no agent can bene t by changing p and no agent will want to deviate from G(q); to  nish the proof we verify that p and G(q) are indeed a valid probability and CDF, respectively.
Before constructing the equilibrium, we note that if a1   c(0), i.e., the maximum possible reward is less than the cost of producing the lowest possible quality, no agent can derive nonnegative utility from participating in G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) irrespective of the actions of other agents.
In this case, the only equilibrium is that no agents participate in G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) (i.e., p = 0; the choice of G(q) is meaningless), which is not very interesting.
In what follows, therefore, we will assume that a1 > c(0).
First, from Theorem 3.1, we know that a mixed strategy equilibrium (p, G(q)), if one exists, has support on an interval [0,  q] with G(0) = 0 and G( q) = 1.
Also, since G(q) is continuous, the payo  at quality q   [0,  q] is  (q) = U (p(1   G(q))   c(q), where U (x) is the function de ned in (2).
Using the fact that 0 belongs to the support and G(0) = 0 (no mass points), we can write the payo  at 0 as  (0) = U (p)   c(0) n 1(cid:88) i=0 (cid:32) (cid:33) n   1 i = ai+1 (1   p)n 1 ipi   c(0).
If p = 1, U (p) = U (1) = an an   c(0).
But for p to be an equilibrium probability of participation, we must have  (0)   0.
Therefore, p can be 1 only if an   c(0), i.e., if an < c(0) then p < 1 in equilibrium.
Conversely, if an   c(0), we must have p = 1 in equilibrium.
At p = 1,  (0) = an   c(0)   0.
Since U (p) is a strictly decreasing function of p on (0, 1),  (0) > 0 for any p < 1.
But then if p < 1, an agent has an incentive to deviate and increase the probability of participation since payo s are strictly positive, contradicting the fact that p is an equilibrium participation probability.
Therefore, p = 1 if and only if an   c(0).
For (p, G(q)) to be an equilibrium, we must have equal payo s throughout the support, i.e.,  (q) = K for all q   [0,  q].
Further, since (p, G(q)) is a free entry equilibrium, no agent must have an incentive to change her decision to participate.
This means that if p < 1, we must have K = 0, i.e., equilibrium payo s must be zero unless p = 1.
We now use this together with the previous argument to construct our equilibrium.
satis es (cid:32) (cid:33) ai+1 n   1 i n 1(cid:88) i=0 (1   p)n 1 ipi = c(0).
(4) Note that the left-hand side is a continuous, strictly decreasing function of p on (0, 1), taking value a1 at p = 0 and an at p = 1.
Therefore there is a unique solution in (0, 1) to this equation when c(0) satis es an < c(0) < a1, i.e., there is a unique solution p which is a valid probability.
pate (p=1), an agent choosing 0 quality comes in last (recall that there is no mass point at 0) and gets bene t an.
(cid:32) (cid:33) ai+1 n   1 i n 1(cid:88) i=0 (1 p(1 G(q)))n 1 i(p(1 G(q))i = c(q).
for each q in [0,  q], where  q is the unique solution (since c(q) is strictly increasing) to c( q) = a1.
Note that the value of  q is that which solves G( q) = 1 in the equation above.
G(q) has support on the interval [0,  q], where c( q) = a1   an + c(0), and G(q) is given by the solution to n 1(cid:88) (cid:32) n   1 (cid:33) i i=0 ai+1 (1   p(1   G(q)))n 1 i(p(1   G(q))i = c(q) + an   c(0) for each q in [0,  q].
Again, note that  q is obtained by setting G( q) = 1 in the equation above.
To verify that our construction is indeed an equilibrium, note that no agent has an incentive to deviate and choose a di erent p: when p < 1,  (q) = 0 so there is no bene t from increasing or decreasing p, and  (q)   0 for p = 1 so no agent wants to decrease participation in this case.
Also, no agent wants to deviate from G(q) conditional on participating:  rst,  (q) is equal for all q   [0,  q], so an agent might only want to deviate by choosing quality greater than  q.
But note that in both cases (p < 1 and p = 1),  (q) = U ( q)   c(q) <  ( q) for any q >  q, since an agent choosing  q is guaranteed to win the maximum possible reward anyway (recall that G has no mass points, speci cally at  q).
So no agent wants to deviate from (p, G(q)).
We have already veri ed that the value of p lies between 0 and 1, i.e., it is a valid probability.
The last thing we need to verify is that the distribution G(q) computed in both cases is indeed a CDF (note that the claimed properties of G, namely continuity with support on [0,  q] follow directly from the continuity of U (x) in x and c(q), and by construction).
To show this, we need to show that that G is increasing on (0,  q), i.e., (cid:18)  U (cid:19)  q (cid:18)  U (cid:19)
 /
  q = is nonnegative on (0,  q).
Now, observe that in either case (an   c(0) or an < c(0)), G(q) can be written as the solution to U (p(1   G(q))) = c(q) + max{an   c(0), 0}, where p is determined appropriately.
Therefore, U (q) = c(q) + max{an   c(0), 0} is a strictly increasing function of q, i.e.,  U  q > 0.
Also, with x = p(1   G), =  p =
  x    x



  x .
Using the expression in (3), and the fact that ai   ai+1 with strict inequality for some i,  U  G > 0 on (0,  q).
So we have (cid:18) (cid:18)  U (cid:19)  q
  q = /  p
  x > 0 (cid:19) on (0,  q) (recall that a1 > c(0) by assumption, so p > 0).
By construction, G(0) = 0 and G( q) = 1, so G(q) is increasing and lies in [0, 1] for q   [0,  q].
So G(q) is a valid CDF.
The following two facts about the equilibrium are immediate from the proof above.

We begin with investigating the design of incentives in the context of attention rewards.
Such attention rewards arise, for example, in sites that are based on user-generated content (UGC) such as Q&A forums like Quora or Stack-Over ow, or Amazon reviews.
In these settings, there is some available amount of attention reward for the top  spot  or answer (derived from all the viewers who read the contribution displayed  rst), a smaller amount for the second spot (corresponding to the viewers that continue on to the second), and so on, i.e., some maximum possible rewards A1, A2, .

we discuss in  5: the total available reward (cid:80)n Attention rewards have an unusual constraint when contrasted with monetary or virtual points rewards of the kind i=1 Ai cannot be arbitrarily redistributed amongst agents since, to a  rst approximation, attention to the second spot comes from a subset of viewers providing attention to the  rst.
Thus, while it is possible to freely increase or decrease each of the rewards ai between 0 and Ai (subject, of course, to the monotonicity constraint, i.e., ai   ai+1), it is not easy to take away reward from a2 and redistribute it to a1.3 Now, a site featuring UGC could suppress some of the UGC, e.g.
by only showing the top-ranked content, or reducing the prominence of lesser ranked content, i.e., the site could choose ai < Ai by not always (or never) displaying the ith ranked contribution.
Does this strategy improve the quality of the best contribution supplied?
On the one hand, equilibrium qualities should rise, because the payo  to poor quality falls.
However, the payo  to supplying any content also falls, so participation falls as well.
How do these two e ects interact?
What if we were interested in a di erent metric of performance, and not just in the best contribution  for example, do the qualities of the average contribution, or the quality of the second best or third best contribution behave the same way as the quality of the best contribution as a function of ai, or do they behave di erently?
Intuitively, it seems plausible that the solution for maximizing the quality of the best contribution may di er from what maximizes the quality of an average contribution, since lower rewards for non-winning contributions should increase the incentive to be best, but
 in the  rst and second spot can achieve the opposite redistribution, namely increase a2 at the expense of a1, but we do not consider this here since it adversely a ects the user experience.
The analysis in  5 addresses this issue.
the average quality.
The following theorem says that the entire distribution of equilibrium qualities (accounting for the fact that agents participate probabilistically), and therefore every increasing statistic, improves when the rewards for achieving any of the the  rst through last-but-one ranks increases (this uniform improvement is in contrast to the case with redistribution, as we will see in  5).
Therefore, it is optimal to increase each of the a1, a2, .
.
.
, an 1 to the maximum extent possible.
However, the situation is somewhat more subtle for an, the subsidy to the contributor with the lowest possible rank: if the current value of an < c(0) then increasing an improves quality, but if an is fairly large already, i.e., an > c(0) then a decrease in an improves quality.
Lemma 4.1.
The derivative of the probability with which an agent chooses quality greater than q in equilibrium with , is positive for i = 1, .

, n   1 for respect to ai, d(p(1 G)) all q   (0,  q).
The derivative with respect to an, d(p(1 G)) is positive when an < c(0) but negative for an > c(0) for all q   (0,  q).
dan dai Proof.
We have from the equilibrium construction that H(p(1 G), a)   U (p(1 G(q)) c(q) max{an c(0), 0} = 0, (5) where U (x) is the bene t function de ned in (1).

  p(1 G) .
We use the derivative  U nator, with x = p(1   G):  x calculated in (3) for the denomi-(cid:33) (cid:32) n   2 i (ai+2   ai+1) xi(1   x)n 2 i n 2(cid:88) i=0 (cid:33)
  x = (n   1) < 0 (cid:32)
  ai = n   1 i   1 for x   (0, 1), since ai   ai+1 with at least one strict inequality.
For a1, .

.
, an 1, (p(1   G))i 1(1   p(1   G))n i > 0 for q   (0,  q).
Therefore, d(p(1 G)) > 0 everywhere, i.e., increasing the rewards for each of the  rst through n   1th positions always improves the equilibrium distribution.
dai For an, when an < c(0) or equivalently p < 1, = (p(1   G))n 1 > 0,
  an on (0,  q), but when an   c(0) (so that p = 1), = (p(1   G))n 1   1 < 0.
 an Therefore, d(p(1 G)) < 0 for an   c(0).
Thus, the reward for the last position behaves di erently  increasing an until it equals c(0) improves equilibrium qualities, but when an   c(0), increasing an further make the equilibrium qualities worse.
> 0 for an < c(0) but d(p(1 G)) dan dan Recall also from Corollary 3.1 that c( q) = a1   max{an   c(0), 0}, so that the maximum quality in the support decreases linearly with an when an   c(0).
This immediately gives us the following result.
Theorem 4.1.

We now address the question of how to optimally redistribute reward amongst agents to improve equilibrium quality.
This question arises in settings where there is some total available reward that can be distributed in any arbitrary way amongst agents, as in the case of crowdsourcing contests such as TopCoder, or even contests with virtual points, where points have value only relative to the total number of points in the system, so that e ectively there is a  xed budget of available reward.
We note that this setting is the one that has been studied widely in the contest design literature in economics, and in the growing literature on the design of crowdsourcing contests, unlike the setting in  4; the key di erence, as discussed in the section on related work, is that our model allows for endogenous entry.
Which value of (a1, .

, an) leads to the  best  equilibrium outcome amongst all mechanisms G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) with the same expected payout?
What do we mean by  best  outcome, i.e., what is the objective to optimize?
As we will see, unlike in the previous section with attention rewards, not all increasing statistics of the quality distribution need be optimized by the same allocation of rewards.
We will focus largely on the expected quality of the best contribution, since this is the objective of interest in many settings like crowdsourcing contests with an arbitrarily redistributable total reward, and  nally brie y address the expected total quality, which is potentially relevant in settings like Q&A forums such as Y!
Answers.
(cid:33) We  rst write the budget constraint that says we are restricted to redistributing rewards, i.e., the total expected payout to contestants must remain the same.
Since entry is endogenous, the number of participants in equilibrium is a random variable when p < 1, so not all prizes ai are always paid out.
The expected payment to the winners in equilibrium is (cid:32) n(cid:88) with probability(cid:0)n (cid:1)pj(1   p)n j where p is the equilibrium participation probability, is(cid:80)j (cid:32) (cid:33) n(cid:88) n(cid:88) Note that when p = 1, B =(cid:80)n since the payment when j contributors enter, which happens k=1 ak.

W(k) is the probability that a particular one of the n agents who enter with probability p and choose quality from the distribution G(q) is ranked in the kth position.

Case 1: an < c(0), or p < 1.

 Now, recall that each term multiplying (1 p+pG(q)))n 1 this di erence is a density: Bk(q)pG(cid:48)(q) c(cid:48)(q) in (cid:82)  q Bk(q)pG(cid:48)(q)
 .
fk(q) = W(k) = Therefore, the term within the parentheses is the di erence between two densities fs(q) and f1(q), with the property that the  rst density (corresponding to s) puts less weight on higher values of q (formally, it is easy to verify that the two distributions f1 and fs satisfy the MLRP property if s > 1, which implies  rst order stochastic dominance).
Therefore, the right-hand side is the di erence between the expected value of the function (1 p+pG(q)))n 1 computed with respect to the densities fs(q) and f1(q).
Therefore, dEqmax positive if (1 p+pG(q)))n 1 c(cid:48)(q) c(cid:48)(q) (1 p+pG(q)))n 1 is decreasing.
Recall that equivalently that this derivative being non-positive implies that increasing the reward a1, while decreasing as in such a way as to hold the budget constant, improves the expected highest quality.
We now show that a su cient condition for this is that c(cid:48)(q) c(q) is non-increasing in q.
The equilibrium condition gives us: is an increasing function of q or is non-c(cid:48)(q) das (p(1 G(q)))j(1 p(1 G(q)))n j 1aj+1 = 1.
(cid:33) (cid:32) n 1(cid:88) j=0 n   1 j
 c(q) Using this, we have c(cid:48)(q) (cid:33) (1   p + pG(q)))n 1 c(cid:48)(q) c(q) (cid:32) n 1(cid:88) (cid:17)j (cid:16) p(1 G(q)) n   1 j=0 = j p(1   G(q)) (1   p(1   G(q))) j aj+1.
(1 p(1 G(q))) is decreasing in q for every j and Since each aj+1   0 by assumption, we have that if c(cid:48)(q) decreasing in q, then well, completing the proof.
(1 p+pG(q)))n 1 is decreasing in q as c(cid:48)(q) c(q) is Case 2: an   c(0), or p = 1.
In this case, all agents always participate, and the budget constraint simpli es to B =(cid:80)n i=1 ai.
Therefore, (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)B da1 das =  1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)B,a1 Again, the term within parentheses is decreasing in q, so if c(cid:48)(q) is increasing, and the derivative dEqmax is decreasing, then G(q)n 1 c(cid:48)(q) is nonpositive.
c(q) Finally, note that when s = n, dG(q) das = Bk(q)   1   0, so that derivative can be immediately seen to be negative.
Together, we have the result for the case an   c(0).
das This lemma immediately gives us the two main theorems.
The  rst result states that if we are restricted to nonnega-tive rewards ai, i.e., charging for entry is not feasible, then a winner-take-all contest maximizes the expected quality of the best contribution in equilibrium amongst all possible monotone, nonnegative allocations of the total budget amongst participants.
This result agrees with the results from the literature on contest design and crowdsourcing contests which do not model endogenous entry (eg [1, 3]).
Theorem 5.1.
Suppose the cost function c is such that c(cid:48)(q)/c(q) is non-increasing in q.
Then, the expected quality of the best contribution obtained in equilibrium among all monotone nonnegative contests G(a1, a2, .
.
.
, an) that have the same total expected payout, is maximized by a winner-take-all contest, i.e., at (a  The second result states that free entry does not lead to the optimum level of quality for the best contribution, and in fact restricting entry by taxation can improve the maximum equilibrium quality.
rewards (A, 0, .
.
.
, 0), and suppose c(0) > 0.
If the cost c is such that c(cid:48)(q)/c(q) is decreasing in q, then taxing entry locally improves the expected quality of the best contribution in equilibrium.
Theorem 5.2 shows that it is advantageous to tax participants and use the proceeds to subsidize the best quality result, in order to maximize the best quality result.
In models where participation is exogenous, the desirability of a tax would not be surprising, because some additional pro ts can be extracted with no loss of participation.
In contrast, with endogenous entry, a tax will drive down participation, which means we choose the maximum from a smaller number of random variables, potentially leading to a poorer outcome.
It is therefore not surprising that the theorem on the op-timality of a tax requires a condition on the cost function, although we note that this condition is satis ed by linear costs which are typically used in the crowdsourcing contest design literature [4, 1, 3], as well as exponential and other cost functions.
What this condition accomplishes is to insure that the gain from improving the distribution of quality of participants will dominate the loss of participation from a small tax.
Average or total quality.
What if we are interested in the average, or total, quality instead of the maximum quality?
The average quality is simply the expected value of q drawn according to the CDF bution with quality 0: Eqavg =(cid:82)  q
 (cid:82)  q or no contribution, as producing the same utility as a contri-

quality.
Here, unlike the case with attention rewards, we will see that the mechanism that is best for maximum quality need not be the best for average quality.
We state the following two theorems.
Theorem 5.3.
Suppose c(cid:48)(q) = 1, and let denote the expected total quality.
Consider the winner-take-all contest G(a, 0, .
.
.
, 0).
Then dEqavg   0 at G(a, 0, .
.
.
, 0).
das (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)B,a1 This theorem says that for linear cost functions, the equilibrium expected total quality is increased by increasing the reward to the highest rank at the expense of any lower rank at the winner-take-all contest (a, 0, .
.
.
, 0).
Here, there is too much entry for the average or total quality objective as well, and taxation, or charging entrants a small fee that is rebated to the winner, locally improves total quality.
Next, we consider exponential cost functions, c(q) = ekq (k > 0)  here, unlike for linear costs, how the average quality can be improved is a function of the available reward B.
Theorem 5.4.
Suppose c(cid:48)(q)/c(q) = k, where k > 0 is independent of q.
Consider the winner-take-all contest G(a, 0, .
.
.
, 0).
Then dEqavg < 0 for small enough B, while dEqavg (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)B,a1 > 0 for large enough B.
das (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)B,a1 das This theorem says that for exponential costs, the e ect on the expected average quality of increasing a1 while decreasing as to maintain the budget for any s > 1, depends on the value of B: when B is small, taxing entry improves average quality, but when B is large, the average quality is increased by subsidizing entry.
Recall that our results on the expected maximum quality do apply to exponential costs, and suggest that taxing entry is optimal for maximizing the expected quality of the best contribution.
Thus, when the available reward B is large, the mechanisms to maximize the quality of the best and average contributions need not be the same   taxing entry improves the best contribution s quality, whereas subsidizing entry is what improves the total quality of contributions produced over a winner-take-all contest for exponential cost functions and large B.
We are grateful to Matt Jackson for helpful remarks, and in particular suggesting the idea of taxing entry to improve quality.
