A large part of the Internet economy operates by being reliant on online advertisements.
In recent years, targeted advertising has become an attractive o ering where targeting is facilitated by the collection of large amounts of personally identi able information (PII) of end-users.
However, this collection comes at the cost of erosion of privacy of end-users.
Web service providers are collecting more PII about the end-users, often outside the scope of their application (e.g., search engines collecting browsing information via third party aggregators like Doubleclick etc.
[36]).
At the same time, users are becoming more aware of various privacy breaches [4, 38, 42], attracting the attention of regulatory bodies [41].
The economics of the online ecosystem can be summed up by the pithy adage  if you are not the consumer, then you are the product , more speci cally, the product being end-users  PII.
In such an arrangement, it is easy for service providers to attach a value on each users  PII, based on the revenues they can extract.
However, for users to perform a cost-bene t analysis, where the cost is loss of privacy, and the bene t is the service they obtain in return, it is important that they  rst know the value of their PII they are trading away.
There has been a lot of work on users valuating their information [9, 10, 18], and in general users  perceptions about privacy [2, 3, 14].
However, there has been surprisingly little to no work on valuating web-browsing information, even though it is known that privacy leakages can occur while web-browsing [26, 36].
In this paper, we focus on understanding the value that users attach to their own PII,1 while web-browsing.
It is challenging to extract the value that users  put on their own PII.
The valuation could change based on context.
information, although one can imagine other notions of value and utility like satisfaction etc.
We consider money as we are interested in the overall ecosystem of online services that partly hinges on monetizing PII.
Secondly, money is a tangible concept and easier to arrive at as opposed to user happiness.
We will consider other notions of value in future work.
is searching for a restaurant can be di erent than when she is searching for cancer drugs.
Even using the same keywords while searching, but in a di erent context, could lead to di erent valuations of the same PII (e.g.
searching for leisure while at home or at work).
Past work done in this domain has included valuating personal information (e.g., weight, age [18]) as well as location information [10].
However they all rely on surveys that do not leverage contextual factors when the PII was generated and/or released.
In order to leverage these contextual factors, we rely on the re ned Experience Sampling methodology (rESM) [7] (Sec.
3.1.1).
This data collection approach probes users at appropriate times to obtain more reliable answers, as questions are presented to users in-context and hence minimizes retrospective recall and possible errors that come with such recall.
We implemented rESM by means of a browser plugin (Secs.
(3.3, 3.1.2)).
Users get asked speci c questions when they access di erent types of content/services (social networks, search engines,  nance sites, etc.).
We recruited 168 participants living in Spain with a diverse range of demographics (Sec.
3.2), and had them participate in our study for 2 weeks.
We used a reverse second price auction to obtain an honest valuation for di erent types of PII (Sec.
3.1.4).
We also use our methodology to obtain users  perceptions and awareness of the economic usage of their PII by online service providers (Sec.
4.2).
The major  ndings of this work are:   Users value PII related to their o ine identity (age, gender, address, economic status) at about e 25 ( 
 is probed in di erent contexts (e.g.
browsing search sites, webmail, etc.
).
  Moreover, users value PII related to o ine identity higher than PII related to browsing activity, which is about e 7 (  10 USD)2.
  In terms of valuating service speci c PII (e.g.
photos uploaded to social networks, search keywords, online purchases, etc.
), users gave higher valuations to interactions in online social networks (e 12 or   17 USD) and  nance websites (e 15.5 or   22 USD), when compared to activities like search (e 2 or   3 USD) and shopping (e 5 or   7 USD).
  The majority of participants in our study were aware that their PII is being collected when web-browsing, and while they were positive about their PII being used to improve services, they were also negative that it could be monetized by service providers.
  Our results reveal that users prefer to trade their PII for monetary rewards or improved services more than trading it for additional free services or targeted advertisements.
The work presented herein aims at answering the following two research questions:
 the title of this paper.
  RQ1: What monetary value do users assign to di er-ent types of PII3 while being online?
  RQ2: What are the perceptions of users vis-a-vis their PII being monetized, improving existing services and for personalized advertisements?
In order to answer these questions, it is of great importance to consider a user-centric approach.
Previous work addressed related questions and using techniques such as post-study surveys and diaries [6, 30].
These traditional methods could have drawbacks when trying to gather answers for the questions posed above.
For instance, consider a web user Alice who browses the web on a daily basis.
On a given day, Alice searches for symptoms pertaining to an illness she suspects she has.
Alice then sends an email to her friend Bob about this illness.
Some time later, she takes part in a traditional survey and/or diary study that aims at answering the aforementioned research questions.
These techniques would most likely not collect accurate responses due to a number of reasons, including:
 aries su er from recall and selective reporting biases [20,
 searched for some time ago, or what emails she exchanged.
The greater the time that has passed since these actions occurred, the harder it is for Alice to remember and report them accurately in a survey/diary study.
words also depends on the context when she shares her PII (e.g.
how, where and when she came up with the keywords in the  rst place).
So even if Alice is later given keywords related to illness and asked to valuate, she might not remember or recreate the conditions she had when she came up with the keywords and may end up assiging an incorrect value to them.
and assign values to di erent PII in a diary.
This is however burdensome for Alice, who might even consider dropping out of the study.
in a long survey or in a daily diary study, she can get disengaged and provide random values just for the sake of getting the job done.
have Alice valuate information under a diverse set of conditions as accurately as possible, we need her to be motivated.
Answering multiple survey questions could lead to a signi cant number of dropouts if the study does not include an element of engagement.
Next, we present the methodology of our study describing how we tackled these challenges towards providing trustful results for our research questions.
ior.
However it has been shown that information leaked on the web via browsing can be combined to form PII [27], so we use PII to refer to all the information that a user can leave online, knowingly or unknowingly.
In order to address the challenge of users  retrospective recall for PII valuation, we use a re ned version of the Experience Sampling Method (rESM).
Experience Sampling involves asking participants to report on their experiences at speci c points throughout the day.
The method was originally developed in the psychology domain [5] and recently adapted successfully in many studies of Human-Computer Interaction [8, 19, 20, 29].
As Cherubini et al. highlighted [7], the main advantage of ESM is its ability to preserve the ecological validity of the measurements, de ned by Hor-muth et al. as  the occurrence and distribution of stimulus variables in the natural or customary habitat of an individual  [17].
This method is better than recall-based self-reporting techniques by  probing  the participant in close temporal proximity to when a relevant event was produced.
One of the drawbacks of the method is that participants often are sampled at random times and therefore the probing might be invasive for many participants.
This is why in recent years some researchers have proposed to re ne the method by modeling the participants  context [7, 12], and this is what we use.
As a means to perform rESM and further address the challenge of validity of valuations, we instrumented the web browser of participants with a plugin that was able to log the website they were browsing and probe them at the exact time a certain PII was being shared online.
At a high level, the study operated as follows.
First, participants installed the plugin and browsed as usual.
Then the plugin would categorize every website the user would browse into one of the eight categories: Email, Entertainment, Finance, News, Search, Shopping, Social, and Health.
These categories closely correspond to the eight popular categories that online ad-networks like Doubleclick4 use, as we are interested in the monetary aspect of PII.
In addition, the plugin was able to sense when the user was changing context and use this information to trigger a popup, which would have two goals: (i) collect the user s valuation of speci c PII related to the category of the site the user is browsing, via an auction and (ii) inquire the user about perceptions of PII usage.
Finally, the popup would send this data to a remote server for data analysis.
With respect to preventing the user s burden, we adjusted the frequency of the popups triggered by the browser plugin and also allowed users to skip them if they wanted to.
In order to provide users with an element of engagement to participate actively in the study, we created a real setting where participants could trade their PII for money based on their own valuations.
More speci cally, participants received the winning monetary value of every auction they won.
than 600 subcategories.
We chose eight as a good trade-o  between obtaining detailed information without annoying the user, given that the rESM probing would increase linearly with the number of categories.
In order to persuade participants to provide an honest valuation of their PII, we relied on a reverse second price auction: given a set of k bids, pick the lowest bidder as the winner, and pay that person the amount equivalent to the second lowest bid.
We chose this auction mechanism for the following reasons: (i) this mechanism has the strong property of being truth telling; the best strategy for participants in the auction is to be honest about their valuation [24], (ii) it has been used before for valuating location information [10], and (iii) it is relatively easy to explain.
We allowed positive amounts, including 0, with increments of one cent.
We also gave the user a choice to not participate in the auctions at all.
This was necessary to cover cases where users felt overwhelmed with participation and cases where users did not even want to disclose the fact that their PII was worth a very high amount.
In order to reinforce the notion that the user would indeed part with their PII if they won, we had the user verify that they understood their data would be sold in a second popup.
We ran an auction whenever we had 20 bids per category from 20 di erent users.
We considered this amount of bids to provide an adequate tradeo  between a lower bound on the number of participants to create competitiveness and an upper bound on the number of participants bids that would be feasible to obtain within a reasonable amount of time.
Multiple auctions were run during the study.
All winners of the auctions were noti ed by email with information including their winning bid, contextual information of the bid (date and time of bid, PII, website they were on).
We reinforced the message that as they won, we would use their PII (showing the exact PII they bid on), for a period of 6 months.
Likewise, we sent a similar email to the remainder participants, conveying that as they lost the bid, their PII would not be used.
Only after the end of the study we informed participants that their PII was actually not going to be used for any commercial purposes.
For all our communication with users, we used neutral language with regards to privacy, so as to not prime them one way or another, following the  ndings in Braunstein et al. [6].
Participants were recruited using a survey published via a major Web portal in Spain, that attracts a very diverse set of users.
A total of 168 participants (93 male, 55%) installed the Firefox browser plugin and completed all requirements of the study.
All participants were users of the Firefox browser and hence had it installed on their computer.
Participants  age ranged between 18 and 58 years old ( x = 31.83, s = 8.15).
With respect to their educational level, 1% did not  nish primary school, 8%  nished primary school, 14% did secondary school, 75% had a university graduate degree, and 2% a postgraduate degree.
Socioeconomic status was also diverse: 28% of the sample said their annual gross salary to be lower than e 10K, 25% said it was between e 10K and 20K, for 22% it was in the range of e 20K and 30K, 11% between e 30K and 40K, and 10% reported earning more than e 40K per year (4% preferred not answering this question).
All participants lived in Spain and the vast majority were of Spanish nationality (94%).
Each participant was given a gift card voucher worth e 10 (  14 USD) for taking part in the whole study.
Our ethical board and legal department approved the experiment.
Par-191ticipants were debriefed about what was being logged and instructed on how to temporarily disable or remove the plugin.
Participants were free to leave the experiment at any time.
In order to capture the browsing context of the users we developed a system consisting of two parts: a browser plugin   to be installed in participants  browsers   and a web server that communicated with the plugin, sending con guration information and receiving data from it.
Firefox Plugin: The plugin had three main tasks.
First, it captured and stored all browsing activity of the user.
This consisted of the url, time of page access, and a unique ID we assigned to each browser.
This data was stored on the local machine and sent to the server at regular intervals.
The second main task of the plugin was to categorize visited websites into one of the eight categories mentioned in Sec.
3.1.2.
In order to do this, we relied on a hard-coded list of 1184 popular sites from di erent categories for Spain, gleaned from alexa.com.
Although some popular sites like Facebook can host content pertaining to health or entertainment, we hard-coded it to Social.5 For sites that were not on Alexa, we resolved them into categories in real-time by relying on an approach implemented in another browser plugin called Adnostic [40].
The basic idea is to perform a cosine similarity between the set of keywords present on the site the user visits and a massive corpus of words that are associated with speci c categories.
The category with the highest similarity score is used and the appropriate text is presented in the pop-up.
Testing on individual unclassi ed and Alexa-classi ed websites gave a high level of accuracy (approx.
98% correct classi cation).
Third, the plugin presented the participants with two independent popups, as described earlier.
The  rst popup displayed auction questions and the other displayed questions related to exploitation of PII.
These were con gured to be switched on or o  from the server.
From a UI perspective, the popup displayed the text of relevant auction question, with the type of PII in the auction in bold text, to highlight what is actually being traded in the auction.
There was a box below the text where the user could enter an amount, and there was a radio button below the box where the user could select to not participate in the auction.
Fig. 1 shows an example of a popup for category Social.
Server: We developed a simple, highly responsive web-server that the browser plugin would sync with at regular intervals.
The server accepted data (bids, responses to questions) from the plugin and stored it in a database.
The main function of the server was to run auctions.
For each category of website, and for each type of PII (there were 4 types per category, as explained in Section 3.5, questions a1 a4), we set an auction to run once 20 bids were in.
We pooled all these auctions, ran them once every morning, and sent out
 large service providers like Facebook or blogspot host content belonging to multiple categories.
However, we consis-tenly pick the  rst category as put out by Alexa.
This ensures that we do not have any false positives   Facebook will always be categorized as Social.
In addition, the questions we pose users (Table 1) for a certain category are always consistent; questions on Facebook are always related to Social.
We leave a detailed categorization mechanism to future work.

Each auction game was identi ed by a sequential number and a date.

results to participants via emails.
The entire process was automated.
We ran the study in September of 2011.
After following our study advertisement on a famous Web portal and signing up for the study, participants were selected based on our unique  ltering criteria   users of the Firefox web browser   and invited via email to participate in our study.
We asked participants to  ll a recruitment questionnaire which focused on demographics as well as their general Internet privacy knowledge and perception.
We explained to participants that the study consisted of three phases: (1) an initial week where the popups were inactive, and their browsing behavior would be collected, (2) the actual study that lasted two weeks where popups were active, and (3) the  nal questionnaire.
Phase 1.
During the  rst week, the plugin silently recorded the browsing behavior of participants (with their consent).
The information captured during this phase was used to record a user s baseline browsing behavior.
We used this information to make sure that our popups were not interfering with the normal browsing behavior of the participants.
We extracted the frequency distribution across the visited sites for every user.
We will refer to this as the user s  n-gerprint.
Phase 2.
During the experiment, the plugin displayed popups when the participants were browsing the internet.
The popups contained two kinds of questions: questions about valuing PII   used as the basis for the auctions   and questions on participants  perceptions and knowledge of PII.
To avoid the popups being too invasive the plugin displayed at most one popup per category per day.
Additionally, there was a minimum delay of 10 minutes between any two popups.
Phase 3.
At the end of the experiment, we asked participants to  ll in a post-study questionnaire that aimed to clarify the main results obtained during the study.
Table 1 summarizes the questions that we presented to the user during the entire study, along with their associated measures.
We customized popup questions (a1 a4 and p1 p4, described below), according to the context they were asked in.
Questions about PII unrelated to the website currently being visited are context independent.
For instance, a question about a user s age while at a news website could
 be considered context independent.
Conversely, questions about PII that are related to the current website are called context dependent.
For instance,  nancial transactions on a banking website.
Additionally, the content of some questions was customized according to the category of the website they refer to, as explained in Table 1.
Recruitment (r1 r4).
Questions in the recruitment questionnaire aimed to gauge participants  knowledge of privacy related issues.
Privacy Valuation (a1 a4).
These questions were presented to participants with a plugin popup during the auctions, and asked them to bid the minimum value they would accept to sell their PII.
We were deliberately vague about how we were going to use their PII for two reasons: (i) to realistically re ect the conditions that exist today, as there is little knowledge of how one s PII is being used (targeted advertisements, price discrimination [31]), and (ii) not to bias the user by providing a speci c use case of their PII; for instance using PII for behavioral targeting can be construed positively or negatively.
Question a1 is context independent.
Its purpose was to assess the validity of our measures by contrasting with results from a2.
Indeed, a2 and a3/a4 were context dependent, but while the former asks about the same PII item across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`&]A^&)*/,#)&A"0&A+,/:&_($)*+",,/+0$J&]/^&)*/,#)&A"0&/(H*+",&F/.$J&/,#&]4^&)*/,#)&A"0&4$0H$4*+",&"A&Y@@&.",$*+L/*+",Z&&I&!()*".+L$#&4$0&H/*$F"03R&a./+:R&b#/*/&/K"(*&",$&"A&*B$&H",*/H*)&*B/*&3"(&$./+:&."0$&"A*$,c`&a,*$0*/+,.$,*R&b*B/*&3"(&B/=$&=+)+*$#&*B+)&D$K&d+*$c`&S+,/,H$R&b#$*/+:)&/K"(*&3"(0&:/)*&A+,/,H+/:&*0/,)/H*+",c`&<$D)R&b*B$&:/)*&,$D)&"0&/0*+H:$)&*B/*&3"(&0$/#c`&d$/0HBR&b*B$&D"0#)&*B/*&3"(&()$#&+,&3"(0&:/)*&)$/0HBc`&dB"44+,FR&b#$*/+:)&/K"(*&*B$&:/)*&40"#(H*&"0&)$0=+H$&*B/*&3"(&K"(FB*&",:+,$c`&d"H+/:R&b",$&"A&*B$&4B"*")&*B/*&3"(&B/=$&(4:"/#$#&*"&*B+)&D$K&)+*$c`&/,#&e$/:*BR&b#$*/+:)&/K"(*&*B$&:/)*&*+.$&3"(&D$0$&)+H1cZ&9(H*+",&_($)*+",&/E&+)&)+.+:/0&*"&/CJ&K(*&+,H0$/)$)&*B$&,(.K$0&"A&Y@@&+*$.)&K3&5fZ&II&!()*".+L$#&4$0&H/*$F"03R&d"H+/:R&b3"(&)B/0$&D+*B&3"(0&A0+$,#)c`&a,*$0*/+,.$,*R&b3"(&)B/0$&DB$,&3"(&A+::&+*)&A"0.)c`&e$/:*BR&b3"(&/0$&:""1+,F&A"0&B$0$c`&d$/0HBR&b3"(0&)$/0HB&B+)*"03c`&S+,/,H$R&b/K"(*&3"(0&A+,/,H$&.+FB*&K$&)B/0$#&D+*B&"*B$0&H".4/,+$)c`&a./+:R&b*B$&H",*$,*&"A&3"(0&$./+:&.$))/F$)c`&dB"44+,FR&b3"(0&)B"44+,F&K$B/=+"0c`&<$D)R&b3"(0&,$D)&0$/#+,F&B+)*"03cZ&III&!

Our goal was not to produce generalized estimates of context valuation but rather to understand whether online context had an in uence on the valuation that people attach to certain types of PII.
Furthermore, we chose to ask a2 as this is the information that most entities engaged in large scale tracking across the web (like DoubleClick) have access to, and hence can monetize.
These are often referred to as  third  parties.
Questions a3-a4 are category speci c and in most cases, this PII is available only to the service provider actually providing that service (e.g., photos on social networks,  nancial transactions, online purchase history, etc.
).
These are referred to as publishers or  rst  parties.
Privacy Perception (p1 p4).
These questions were also presented with a plugin popup, and were designed to understand if users are aware of monetization of their PII by online entities.
Exit (f1 f4).
These questions were asked in the  nal questionnaire in order to clarify results obtained during the study.
Nonparametric analysis was applied to the data considering the ordinal nature of some observed variables and that continuous variables did not follow the normal distribution.
Given that participants browsed web pages in their natural environment without being forced to visit sites from all categories mapped in our study   thus preserving ecological validity, our sample had several missing values across categories.
Removing subjects that did not provide information for all categories   as they did not browse all types of web pages   would signi cantly reduce the generalization power of our results and yield unrealistic  nd-ings based on the assumption that everybody browses web pages from all categories considered in this study.
Therefore we opted for not using related sample analysis.
Hence di erences between median bid values (or Likert scale measures) across categories were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test whenever appropriate.
Associations between ordinal/interval variables were assessed using the Spearman s Rho test.
Comparisons between related sample distributions of dichotomous variables were performed using both the Cochran s Q test and the Mc-Nemar test.
The level of signi cance was taken as p < .05.
We summarize the main results obtained towards addressing our two research questions.
Our results are mainly reported in Euros, and at the time the conversion was approx.
e 1 gives 1.42 USD.
E ect of pop-ups on browsing behavior.
We used the L2 distance between participants   rst week s  baseline   ngerprints and their  ngerprints for the second week of the study after pop-ups were turned on and found little di er-ences (165 users had less than 5% di erence).
Speci cally, only three users (2% of the sample) had high browsing behavior deviation and reported being on vacation during the second week, thus explaining why they used their browser sparsely.
These  ndings indicate that users did not deviate from their  normal  browsing behavior when participating in the study.
Representativeness of categories.
We look into the bidding behavior of the whole sample (N = 168) while browsing websites as they map to each of the 8 categories and also in relation to the nature of the information being sold (see questions a1-a4 in Table 1).
Overall, participants visited websites from all of the eight categories, Health being the least visited category (Search: 82%, Entertainment: 82%, Social: 78%, News: 76%, Finance: 75%, Shopping: 75%, Email: 64%, Health: 2%).
Given the lack of representativeness for the number of subjects visiting health related web pages, we therefore consider only seven categories when comparing participants  bids and other relevant measures across categories.
Bids on context independent PII.
With respect to selling their PII that is related to their o ine identity (i.e., age, gender, address and salary; see question a1 in Table 1), we found no signi cant di erence among participants  median bid values across categories (p = .702).
Note that this result was somewhat expected as question a1 was context independent   no mention was made to selling the participants  PI to an entity related to the website they were browsing.
The overall median bid value across categories was e 25.
Bids on context dependent PII.
When probed about selling clicks they performed on a given web page (see question a2 in Table 1), which represents their browsing behavior, participants  median bids were again not signi cantly di erent across categories (p = .569).
In this case, the overall median bid value was e 7.
Median bid values for highly category speci c PII   as captured by questions a3 and a4 in Table 1   revealed signi cant di erences across categories (p < .001).
The highest median bid values (in euros) were from categories Finance ( x = 15.5), Social ( x = 12), and Email ( x = 6), with Finance similar to the latter two categories (p = .31 and p = .09 respectively) and signi -cantly di erent from the remaining categories (Shopping =
 Table 2 summarizes the most relevant descriptive statistics of median bid values per category.
E ectiveness of the auction: Categorization of the participants  free text responses to why they bid so low/high in their lowest/highest bids (in euros) was categorized manually with an acceptable inter-rater reliability (lowest bid: K = .77, p < .001; highest bid: K = .78, p < .001).
Even considering the extreme case of each participant s lowest bid, only 15% explained that they bid that low in an attempt to win the auction.
The majority said it was because the information was not important (50   51%) or they thought it was a fair value (8%   10%), or due to some other reason (25%   26%).
On the other hand, highest bids were mainly due to prevent selling important information (53%   58%), although also being explained as a fair value (16%  22%) or due to some other reason (22%).
Note that there are subtle di erences between a  fair  value assigned to information, and very high/low values assigned because information was very important or not important at all.
Fair value indicates a more reasoned approach while bidding very high values indicates focus on the outcome (no selling under any circumstance).
Bidding very low values indicates nonchalance; value of information is so low that it isn t worth reasoning about.
The fact that only 18 zero   11 winings bids   bids were placed during the whole auction period is an indication that participants were not bidding just for the sake of winning.
Very few participants (3%  4%) explained
 3rd quartiles shown between brackets their highest bid as a strategy to win the auction.
These results could indicate that the rules of the reverse second price auction were understood.
Overall, the results indicate that the auction scheme is indeed e ective for truth telling, given that the majority gave reasons of fair value or worth of information for bids instead of trying to game the system.
Bulk PII e ect.
We veri ed no signi cant di erence between the median bid value for all categories in question a3 ( xa3 = 5) and in question a4 ( xa4 = 5, p = .59).
This  nding indicates that the amount of information being sold was not a factor for participants when placing their bids, as they valued one piece of information (question a3) and 10 pieces of information of the same type (question a4), to be used for the same period of time if sold, in a similar way.
Winning bids and payouts.
Considering the 40 subjects that won at least one auction, their median winning bid was of 5 cents of Euro (min = 0,  x = 0.19, max = 2.29).
Even though we allowed a bid of 0 as a valid bid, only seven winners bid 0 on 11 occasions, out of 4000+ bids.
The other winners  bids were strictly positive.
Finally, as we used the reverse second price auction, the median payout was actually 45 cents of Euro (min = 0.01,  x = 0.65, max = 5.69).
We describe this result for completeness.
Trading PII for alternative goods.
At the end of the study, we wanted to understand if there were preferred goods participants would be willing to trade their PII for, and if the preferred goods would be di erent across the most popular categories, i.e. Social, Email and Search (question f2 from Table 1).
According to our results, participants   rst choice was to either exchange their PII for money (32% 37% of participants) or have improvements in services they are currently using (33%   37%).
The second choice was to receive more free services (14%   18%).
No signi cant differences were found between distributions of each strategy across the three categories (money: Q = 2.000, p = .37, better services: Q = 1.042, p = .59, free services: Q = 1.805, p = .41).
Interestingly, receiving PII-based recommendations was the third option for social networks (7%), but rather the fourth for Email (2%) and Search (4%), with a signi cant di erence between them (Q = 6.167, p = .046).
Fig. 2 shows a graph comparing the participants  preferred monetization strategies across the three categories.
Relationship between bids, demographics, and privacy.
We next looked into signi cant associations between variables captured in the recruitment questionnaire and the participants  bids.
Our  ndings reveal a medium negative correlation between participants  age and their median bid values for question Social-a3 (n = 64,   =  .276, p = .03).
Similarly, age is negatively correlated to the combination of questions Social-a3 and Social-a4 (n = 69,   =  .287, p = .02), thus providing evidence that the older people are, the lower they tend to bid on photos they share online.
Furthermore, we found a medium negative association between Figure 2: Participants  preferred goods in exchange of PI to online social networks, email providers, and search engines.
gender (1 = male, 2 = female) and median bids for question Email-a3 (n = 45,   =  .333, p = .03).
This result indicates that men might value information related to their email contacts more than women.
Correlations between income levels and bid values were not signi cant.
Finally, we found medium negative correlations between participants  education level and their median bid values for question a2 in most categories (Entertainment:   =  .277, Finance:   =  .282, Search:   =  .235, Shopping:   =  .32).
We also correlated bid values with responses provided to privacy-relevant questions in the recruitment questionnaire.
Positive correlations were found between being worried about online data protection and higher bids on context independent PII (question a1, Entertainment:   = .252, Finance:   = .278, Search:   = .23).
age of PII Results presented in this subsection contribute to the understanding of how users  perceive the economic usage of their PII by online service providers.
Note that we considered only the  rst answers that participants gave to questions p1 p4 per category.
This decision guaranteed that their initial opinion would be taken into account instead of a potentially biased opinion due to the e ect of long exposure to the study.
Knowledge of PII-based monetization.
Participants were aware that PII shared on a particular web site could be used to generate revenue (question p1,  x = 4, q1 = 2, q3 =
 median ratings across categories (p = .107).
This  nding suggests that knowledge of PI-based monetization is related to Internet services in general and not to a particular set of services.
Comfort with PII-based monetization.
In question p2, participants revealed how comfortable they were with web sites extracting revenue out of their PII.

From this  nding, we conclude that the act of monetizing from users  PII is what generally makes people uncomfortable, and not the type of online service providers the revenue will go to (e.g.,  nance, search, etc.
).
Improving services with PII.
Although not comfortable with their PII being monetized, participants pointed out that they would like online companies to improve their web services using their PII (question p3,  x = 4, q1 = 3, q3 = 4).
No signi cant di erence was found between participants  median ratings across categories (p = .869).
This  nding is consistent with results presented in Fig. 2 about money and improved services being the participants  preferred PII monetization strategies.
PII-based publicity/ads.
Finally, subjects were in-di erent with regards to online service providers making personalized publicity/ads by using their PII (question p4,  x = 3, q1 = 3, q3 = 4).
Once again no signi cant di er-ence could be identi ed between participants  median ratings across categories (p = .686).
This  nding suggests that leveraging users  PII to provide them with personalized ads generally have neither a negative nor a positive impact on people.
Perception of costs and revenues.
Participants were more con dent about revenues than costs of providing social network, email, and search services (answered  do not know : 3% vs. 29%, 10% vs. 24%, 6% vs. 21% respectively).
In general, most participants agree that these service providers have high revenues (93%, 69%, and 89% respectively) and high costs (43%, 45%, and 53% respectively), but the perception of revenues is signi cantly higher than costs (p < .001 for each of the three categories).
Finally, more participants perceived search services to have signi cant costs compared to email (68% n = 117 vs. 58% n = 113, p = .02), while more participants perceived social net work and search services to have signi cant earnings compared to email (97% n = 143 vs. 77% n = 133, p < 001;
 results reveal that users might consider social network services to be more pro table than search or email services.
The conclusions that can be derived from our results (Sec.
4) are: Users value o ine PII more and online PII less: If we consider the results for a1, the question on valuating o ine PII (Sec.
4), users consistently bid high values for their o ine PII like age, gender, address and  nancial status; pieces of PII that form their o ine identity, to trade with online entities.
Likewise, users attach lower value to a2, a3 and a4, PII that mostly has to do with their online behavior (a2 is exclusively about browsing history, the other two are about online transactions).
Digging deeper, we also note that users tend to value category-speci c PII (a3 and a4) on Finance and Social, categories that are more explicitly intertwined with one s o ine identity, more than Search and News.
We conjecture that the di erence in valuation exists because of lack of awareness.
O ine PII is easier to valuate as it is more explicit.
It is harder to understand the implications of having your PII continuously tracked, data-mined, and linked to an o ine identity [13, 37].
As a consequence, users value such PII less.
Higher valuations than previous studies: Previous studies on valuation of privacy or personal information have reported lower values for various PII than what we encounter in our results [23].
This could be for two reasons.
First, we use experience sampling that puts emphasis on valuating PII during web-browsing at the appropriate time, and second, speci c properties of the demographics (Spanish citizens) could play a role.
We note here that the regulatory framework surrounding privacy in EU is much stricter than in other parts of the world and this could a ect the norms related to privacy and personal information of users.
We also note that cultural norms can play a role.
Addressing these concerns is beyond the scope of this work.
High variation of PII valuation: Bid values show great variance, as it can be seen in the di erence between the  rst and third quartiles of the seven categories (see Table 1).
We envision two hypotheses that could explain our participants  behavior that led to this observation: either (i) di erent PII can largely di er in terms of bidding prices, or (ii) people indeed have very little idea about how much their PII should be valued.
Future work will look into this.
Users do not distinguish between quantity of PII, but type: We compared the median bid values for a3 and a4 across categories and found no signi cant di erence.
These two auction questions di er only in quantity of information being traded, with the type of PII and the context remaining the same.
As reported earlier, there are signi cant differences between type (Finance and Social being higher than Search, Shopping etc.)
We correlated the values with demographic information as well as the responses to the privacy related questions (r1-r4).
We found weak to no correlation.
A possible conjecture can be on the lines of what is reported in [9], that users factor in diminishing returns of more information in their valuation   although we have no evidence to support or refute this conjecture.
Older users less concerned about online PII: When we correlated bid values against demographics, a high (negative) correlation occurred between age and category speci c PII on Social, Entertainment and News, and more so while valuating bulk information (a4).
For Social, this can be linked to the fact most older users do not use online social networks, let alone upload photos to online social networks.6 This result is in contrast to previous work that stated that older users are generally more concerned about their privacy, while being online [33].
Users do not like monetization of their PII: Users are negative when it comes to their PII being used for mon-etization by entities (question p2), despite knowing that online entities collect and use their PII for monetization (p1).
In addition, they prefer their PII to be used for improving the services they are o ered (ap3), across all categories.
On the one hand, these results are expected   the former deals with monetization of a good (PII) that users probably perceive as theirs, while users view the latter as a positive outcome of their PII being exploited.
In order to understand why users are negative about their PII being monetized, one 6http://www.comscoredatamine.com/2010/09/visitor- demographics-to-facebook-com/ 196can posit that most users are not aware of the functioning of the online ecosystem in place   they do not perceive that the services they get for  free  (storage in Gmail, Bing search, Facebook etc.)
actually are expensive (large datacenters, equipment and bandwidth costs) and while users are aware of their PII being monetized, they are possibly not aware that large parts of that monetization goes towards providing them with a  free  service.
However, when we look at the results from the post-study questionnaire (question f3), we  nd that users indeed seem to be aware of the costs and revenues of di erent services with most users assigning higher revenues than costs for services.
Taken together, users  negative attitude about mon-etization of their PII by services can be due to a feeling of unfairness.
Users are indi erent when it comes to the use of the PII to send them personalized ads (p4), again across categories.
This is somewhat in contrast to results in [30] where the authors report that 64% of the survey respondents (all Americans)  nd behavioral targeting invasive.
The di er-ences between our results and theirs can be due to cultural di erences (our sample consists mainly of people from Spain) and/or methodological di erences   we used experience sampling to capture the context, while the results reported in [30] were gathered via traditional surveys.
Our study has direct implications on the monetization of personal information online.
As the focus of the study has been towards understanding the economic aspects of PII, we believe the  ndings can help in the future research topics and new o erings.
We propose three major implications.
A prominent reason for the failure of adoption of most privacy solutions are the lack of proper incentives (economic or otherwise) for various parties to support the adoption [32].
Consider online privacy; on one side there are online service providers who have stated that they want to move up to the  creepy  line [34] on accessing and using PII, while on the other side users are resorting to unilateral measures like anti-tracking plugins etc.
to prevent data collection, hence deterring service providers from supporting such privacy preserving measures.
Recent privacy preserving solutions have been designed to preserve privacy of the users as well as provide means for online service providers to access and monetize PII via targeted ads, thereby preserving the business models of these providers [15, 40].
Based on our  ndings (Fig. 2) these solutions can have a better chance of adoption if they incorporated some form of economic incentives, by way of monetary compensation to the end-user.
Such economic incentives based solutions have been proposed as well [28, 35], with some startups going for such a model7.
The results in this paper provide the  rst empirical foundation for economic incentives by demonstrating how users value di erent types of PII for a variety of actions performed while online.
The prices can be taken to be the reserve prices8 that users will be willing to accept to part with their 7www.personal.com
 PII.
Likewise, we have seen that di erent types of PII have di erent valuations (e.g.
photos in social networks vs. online purchase history).
These di erences can be used by service providers to strategically target di erent types of PII.
The  ndings in our paper can be used as inputs to drive models to better understand the ecosystem.
For instance, a recent proposal to address privacy breaches using insurance can bene t from our analysis to set premiums [16].
In addition, other types of incentives can also help drive adoption of privacy preserving solutions.
If we consider Fig. 2, users also prefer improved services that use their PII.
If service providers can convince users that there have been improvements to the respective services and which PII bits went into the improvements, users may be less concerned about their privacy.
We asked participants of our study about who they would trust to handle their PII in the case that an entity enables economic transactions around their PII, in the post-questionnaire.
Users trusted themselves more than any other entity ( x = 5.2,  x = 6, q1 = 6, q3 = 6, 6-point scale).
Government was the second most trusted entity ( x = 3.8,  x = 4, q1 = 2, q3 = 5), followed by banks ( x = 3.5,  x = 4, q1 = 3, q3 = 4) and telecommunication companies ( x = 3.4,  x = 3, q1 = 2, q3 = 4) tied in the third place (Z =  .299, p = .77).
Finally, insurance companies were considered the least trustful entities for handling people s PII ( x = 3.1,  x = 3, q1 = 2, q3 = 4).
Trusting oneself with one s PII could point to a totally decentralized architecture for a privacy solution.
However, more work needs to be done to verify if users can undertake the burden of dealing with all the transactions around their PII themselves.
One of the  ndings reported in Sec.
4.2, is that while users have knowledge of their PII being collected, they are not comfortable about their PII being monetized.
This lack of awareness also plays out in valuations   while o ine PII and certain types of online PII like photos and  nancial transactions have high valuations, presence of the user on di erent sites were valued very low.
This is interesting as a behavioral pro le can be constructed just by tracking users across sites (via cookies etc.)
and this pro le can be used to identify users and be monetized [11].
We believe that most privacy concerns that arise are due to lack of awareness of precisely this fact   that PII is being monetized (participants knew their PII could be monetized by entertainment and search related websites, but not for the other categories).
The  ndings reported in this paper indicate that if online service providers are explicit and up front about the fact that they provide a service (email, video streaming, a social network, etc.)
for free and in return collect and monetize PII, along with details on the speci c types of PII they collect, the privacy concerns of most users will be tempered.
Long privacy policies written in complicated legalese that are seldom e ective [21], can be dispensed with.
For example, we can think about agreements that could expose the amount of money required to run the service the user is signing up for and how the revenues generated by exploiting PII help cover those costs.
This implication is further strengthened when we factor in that majority of the users perceive that service providers have higher revenues than costs (Sec.
4.2), hence being transparent about costs can help educate users.
Additionally, we can have alterna-197tive business models where the user has the option to pay for the service that s/he is signing up for either with his/her PII or with real money.
A  nal implication for design is related to the indi erence in valuation for bulk quantity of data.
Speci cally, participants assigned a similar value to a certain piece of PII as to 10 pieces of the same information.
This has a direct consequence for the design of trading PII.
In fact, it does not make sense to implement mechanisms for the trade of a single piece of information.
Rather, it makes more sense  according to these results  to design solutions that would allow interested users to trade a bulk amount of PII.
For instance, such a mechanism could be presented during registration to a new service and extended for bulk amounts of PII that the user will be sharing throughout the use of the service.
The e ect of such a design could be two fold: on one hand it would minimize the user s e ort and mental load, while on the other hand it would maximize the e ectiveness of the service provider s budget expenditure.
Previous research has shown that valuation can depend on the type of information release.
For instance, Huber-man [18] reported that valuation of certain bits of PII like weight and age depends on the desirability of those bits of information in a social context.
Likewise, valuation of location information has been found to depend on factors like the distance traveled by the user and other factors [9, 10].
Our work di ers in multiple regards.
First, we focus on web browsing information of users that is of economic interest to online services (e.g., search providers, social networks) and such information raises privacy concerns [25, 27].
Second, we study the e ects of demographic information like age, gender, education levels and socioeconomic factors on valuation of one s PII.
While the aforementioned works used mostly surveys to  gure out di erent valuations, we use a methodology based on experience sampling to capture PII context and obtain valuations in-situ.
Finally, whereas previous works used hypothetical payments to determine PII valuation [10], we use actual payments, hoping to obtain a more accurate value and have user engagement.
Another body of work that is related has to do with studying the dichotomy that exists between willingness to pay (WTP) to buy privacy protection and willingness to accept (WTA) to reveal PII.
A di erence between WTP and WTA can be indicative of an endowment e ect [39]: people can place a higher value on an object that they own, in this case PII.
In our paper we do not deal with WTP vs WTA explicitly, instead we focus on extracting WTA for web-browsing, while leveraging contextual factors when PII is generated and/or released.
A majority of the work done on understanding the awareness levels of users in terms of how their PII is exploited and related privacy concerns has focused on how the actual behavior of people deviates from what they state.
This deviation has been noted by Jensen & Potts [22] who also found that there is a di erence between reported knowledge and reality; in general people do not seem to know as much about privacy protection measures as they state.
They also report that surveys as a method should not be taken as indicative of users  actual behavior.
Acquisti studies the reasons that affect people s behavior vis-a-vis privacy and reports bounded rationality as well as the practice of hyperbolic discounting [1]; assigning a higher value to actions involving immediate grati cation than those actions leading to long-term protection.
In this work, we focus on understanding people s knowledge and perception of how their PII is exploited from an economic viewpoint, and use experience sampling to capture the behavior and context and as a result, do not su er from the limitations seen in survey-based studies.
Our paper deals with the economic value that users assign to PII.
Previous literature has focused on di erent types of PII, but not web-browsing behavior, which is the focus of this work.
Previous work has also shown that privacy valuation is a di cult problem, as is a ected by a number of technical, legal, social and psychological factors that lead to inconsistencies between what people say and what they actually do.
We attempt to overcome these issues through the use of the re ned Experience Sampling Method and a truth-telling auction mechanism that incentivizes users to participate honestly.
We found that users give more importance to PII related to their o ine identities than to PII that is related to their online behavior.
They mostly do not care about the quantity of PII released but they do care about its type.
Users tolerate the use of their personal information for improving service, they do not like their information to be used to generate revenues.
Users also preferred trading in their PII for money or improved services, and targeted advertising, in this order.
We hope the results in this paper can guide future privacy research and solutions.
