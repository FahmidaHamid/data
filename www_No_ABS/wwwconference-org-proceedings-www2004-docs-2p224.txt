Since Goldberg et al [1] published the first account of using collaborative filtering (CF) for information filtering; CF has proved in recommendation systems such as GroupLens [4].
However, all these systems have used a centralized memory-based CF algorithm which suffered from scalability as it need to calculate similarity between the active users and all other users.
One way to solve this problem is to use a model-based algorithm [3]; however, these approaches also need complex calculation when compiling models.
Another method is to implement CF in a decentralized way [6].
In this paper, we propose a novel distributed hash table (DHT) based technique to implement efficient user database management __________________________________________ * Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.

Figure 1 Architecture of DHT-based CF System

 As Breese presented in [3] by the term inverse user frequency, universally liked items are not as useful as less common items in capturing similarity.
So we introduce a new concept significance refinement (SR) which reduce the returned user number of the basic DHT-based CF algorithm by limiting the number of returned users for each <ITEM_ID, VOTE> tuple.
We term the algorithm improved by SR as Return K which means  for every item, the DHT-based CF algorithm returns no more than K users with same <ITEM_ID, VOTE> tuple .
By doing so, we reduce the calculation complexity from O(M2N) to O(N2), where M is the user number and N is the item number.
Enlightened by the method of case amplification [3] which emphasizes the contribution of the most similar users to the prediction by amplifying the weights close to 1, we argue that we should give special award to the users who rated some items with the same vote by amplify their weights, which we term Unanimous Amplification.
We transform the estimated weights as follows: top-100 user selection on them.
The results are shown as Figure 2.
We can see that the DHT-based algorithm has better prediction accuracy than the traditional CF algorithm.
In this paper, we propose a novel distributed hash table (DHT) based technique to implement efficient user database management and retrieval in decentralized CF system.
Then we propose a heuristic algorithm to fetch similar users from DHT overlay network and do recommendation locally.
Finally, we propose two novel approaches: significance refinement (SR) and unanimous amplification (UA) to improve the performance of our DHT-based CF algorithm.
The experimental data show that our DHT-based CF system has better prediction accuracy, efficiency and scalability than traditional CF systems.

Experimental result shows that UA approach improves the prediction accuracy of both the traditional and DHT-based CF algorithms.
We use EachMovie data set [5] to evaluate the performance of improved algorithm.
We use Mean Absolute Error (MAE), a statistical accuracy metrics, to report prediction experiments for it is most commonly used and easy to understand:

 | Ta   p ja , | | (2) jav , jap , is the rating given to item j by user a, Where is the predicted value of user a on item j, T is the test set, |T| is the size of the test set.
We select 2000 users and choose one user as active user per time and the remainder users as his candidate neighbors, because every user only make self s recommendation locally.
We use the mean prediction accuracy of all the 2000 users as the system's prediction accuracy.
For every user s recommendation calculation, our tests are performed using 80% of the user s ratings for training, with the remainder for testing.
