The literature in education suggests that students who are actively engaged in the learning process will be more likely to achieve success.
Constructivist learning is a student-centered educational approach to effectively motivate the students by enabling a more active, explorative and interactive learning process.
So, how to effectively support constructivist learning becomes an important issue with respect to e-learning.
A number of adaptive and intelligent systems have been implemented to support constructivist learning [1, 2].
By incorporating the intelligent agent and adaptive hypermedia technologies, this paper proposes an active e-course that focuses on dynamic organization of learning materials with various semantic links to better support student-centered, highly interactive and adaptive learning approach.
The general architecture for the constructivist learning is illustrated in Figure 1.
The teaching agent serves as an intelligent tutor by interacting with students (such as course planning, evaluation of learning performance, and profile updating).
The delivering agent is responsible for composing and presenting tailored courses for different students.

The general architecture for constructivist learning.
Course ontology defines course knowledge and structure within a specific domain, which includes course concepts and roles.
A course concept represents a composite or atomic knowledge object with a unique object identifier, and a structure that includes attribute-value pairs and link anchors.
The roles represent the binary relationships among knowledge objects, and the relationship can be one of the following types: Subtype, Sequential, Cause-effect, Implication, Similar-to, Reference, Part-of, Corequisite, Supplement, Contrast, and Inhibitor.
The reasoning rule can be used for chaining the semantic relationships and obtaining the reasoning result from the chaining.

Course ontology is modeled as a nested SLN.
The metadata of learning materials are semi-automatically specified based on the course ontology that provides a shared meaning of used vocabulary.
The metadata falls into three broad categories: structure (the structural information), content (what is about) and context (when to present).

By referring to the students  different demands and activities, semantic links are automatically added into documents, as shown in Figure 2.
In this way, an active e-course dynamically adapts to different students with an open and flexible structure.

Framework for constructing semantic links.
The teaching agent firstly finds an optimal learning path with required knowledge objects for different students by following a two-step process: selecting knowledge objects and structuring knowledge objects.
According to the student profiles, the required knowledge objects are selected.
By using the reasoning rules, the knowledge objects are then sequenced and structured in a reasonable pattern (such as linear, flat, tree, or hybrid pattern).
Following that, the delivering agent generates the course by substantiating each knowledge object with one or more learning resources.
An active e-course is presented with adaptive content and semantic links to the students.

Students  learning effects are evaluated mainly based on the test result.
Each question may be related to multiple knowledge objects with different association degrees.
Obviously, correctly answering a more difficult question shows higher comprehension ability than correctly answering an easier question.
Likewise, failing to answer a more difficult question contributes less to the comprehension ability than that of failing to answer an easier question.
Thus, we use the following formulas to compute the positive influence (Pg) and negative influence (Ng) on the comprehension of knowledge object Kg, respectively.

Being separating from the concept-centered structural model, the learning materials can be adaptively organized and reused in a more flexible and interoperable manner.
In this way, active e-courses with tailored content and open structure are presented to different students.
Furthermore, students  learning effects are automatically evaluated to provide corresponding suggestions.
An authoring tool for constructing course ontology and a course prototype have been implemented to support the constructivist learning (available at http://kg.ict.ac.cn/KGTutor/KGTutor.htm).
