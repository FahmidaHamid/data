To make the Semantic Web vision become reality, we are challenged by the URI meaning issues arising from putting OWL in open and distributed environments.
Recently, there are some impetuous debates on the meaning of URI identifier used by OWL within Semantic Web research community.
For example (See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/), should the meaning of URI be global or local?
Does the use of a URI as a name constitute some kind of a commitment or consent, either to meaning expressed on the web, or intended by a Name-Authority?
As we know, OWL has a mechanism to import an OWL ontology into another OWL ontology.
The owl:imports relationship is transitive, and if ontology O1 imports O2 and O2 imports O1, then they are considered to be equivalent.
The owl:imports construct provides just one mechanism for specifying a special kind of semantic relationship between distributed OWL ontologies.
Recently, Paolo Bouquet et al. [1] give an extension to OWL with context, called COWL, which is based on local models semantics [2] and distributed description logics [3].
COWL allows us to contextualize ontologies.
It s definitely a good start towards formal semantics for distributed ontologies.
However, the vocabularies of local ontologies are supposed to be pairwise disjointed, and the globalization can only be obtained by using Copyright is held by the authors.
zqgao@seu.edu.cn explicit mappings.
It doesn t fit very well in with one of the basic architectural principles of the Web, which allows anyone be able to freely add information about an existing resource using any vocabulary they please.
Our position to the meaning issues is as follows: A name is meaningless for machine without context, and the distributed ontologies should be the key component of the context.
We should find a way to make it clear what  a distributed ontology  should have in addition to a set of local ontologies, and how to interpret  a distributed ontology .
To simplify the presentation of our formalism, the distributed ontologies are assumed to be OWL DL ontologies.
Some terminologies are as follows: A name is a URI (literal is not discussed for simplicity).
The vocabulary of an ontology is the set of names that occur in the ontology as individuals, classes and properties, except for built-ins.
We use   to denote a set of ontologies {Oi | i I}, here I be a set of indexes.
V(Oi) denotes the vocabulary of Oi, while VI(Oi), VC(Oi) and VP(Oi) denote the individual, class, and property vocabulary of Oi, respectively.
The vocabulary of  , denoted by V( ), is the union of the vocabularies of ontologies within  , more formally, V( )={  |  V(Oi), Oi }.
And VI( ), VC( ) and VP( ) denote the individual, class, and property vocabulary of  , respectively.
We assume that VI( ), VC( ) and VP( ) are pairwise disjointed.
Example 1.
(Motivation example) Consider  ={O1, O2}: O1: SubClassOf(A B); SubClassOf(B C) O2: SubClassOf(C D); SubClassOf(D A) How to interpret the integration of the above two ontologies (with some names shared)?
The available approaches couldn t give a satisfied answer to this question.
Basically, our approach is based on the principle of local models semantics [2], i.e. local ontology has its own interpretation universe, and these universes are related with each other by relations.
In addition, the URI should and could be shared with different ontologies under some restriction.
Such sharing is realizable under agreement on vocabulary provenance, and can be enriched by commitment relationship within distributed ontologies.
Definition 1.
(Agreement on vocabulary provenance) Let   be a set of ontologies {Oi | i I}, an agreement on vocabulary provenance within   is a function from V( ) to I, denoted by  :V( )   I, such that  V(O ( )) for each  V( ), i.e. for each  V( ),  ( )   { i I |  V(Oi), Oi  }.
We call  ( ) the provenance of the name   within  .
From now on, we use the term  a distributed ontology  to mean a set of ontologies plus an agreement on vocabulary provenance.
Usually, we use ( ,  ) to denote a distributed ontology.
We interpret distributed ontologies on the notion of local models [2, 3], and evolve it with the presence of agreement on vocabulary provenance.
Definition 2.
(Interpretations for distributed ontologies) Let   = {Oi | i I } be a set of ontologies with   as an agreement on vocabulary provenance.
An interpretation of ( ,  ), denoted by  , is composed of a pair <{ i}i I,{rij}i,j I> such that
  i is an OWL DL interpretation of Oi (satisfying all of the axioms within Oi) with local domain of  i.
rij is the domain relation from i to j, i.e. a subset of  i    j.
(each rii is always assumed to be the identity relation on  i)

 If  V(Oj) and  ( ) = i, then  j = rij( i)
 In this paper, we use rij(S) (for S being a subset of  i) to denote the image of S via the domain relation rij, more formally, rij(S) = {y j |  x S such that <x, y> rij }.
Notice that an element can be seen as a singleton set.
We use rij(R) (for R being a binary relation on  i) to denote the image of R via 1, i.e. rij(R) = {<y1, y2> j j rij, more formally, rij(R) = rij   R   rij |  x1, x2 i such that <x1, y1> rij, <x1, x2> R, and <x2, y2> rij}.
Hence, the harmonization constraint can be refined as follows: If  VI(Oj) and  ( )=i, then { j} = rij({ i}) (HCI) If  VC(Oj) and  ( )=i, then  j = rij( i)
 If  VP(Oj) and  ( )=i, then  j = rij    i   rij -1
 Example 2.
(Revisit example 1) Suppose there is an agreement on vocabulary provenance within  ={O1, O2} such that: Let <{ 1,  2}, {r12, r21}> be an interpretation of ( ,  ).
We have  (A) =1,  (B) =1,  (C) =2,  (D) =2 A 1   B 1  r21(C 2) (i.e. C 1) C 2   D 2  r12(A 1) (i.e. A 2)

 We can not obtain that EquivalentClasses(A C) in O1 or O2 in general because there is no constraint on the domain relations r12 and r21, e.g.
r12(r21(C 2))====C 2.
That s fine because it reflects the case where there are two different viewpoints coexisted.
We will revisit this example after the introduction of commitment relationship.
Definition 3.
(Commitment relationship) Let ( ,  ) be a distributed ontology, a commitment relation on  , denote by  , is a binary relation on  .
We say Oj commits to Oi when <Oi, Oj>  .
A complete commitment relation on  , denote by  , is a sub-relation of commitment relation on   and required to be transitive.
Definition 4.
(Satisfying of commitment).
Let   ==== ( ,  ,  ,  ) be a distributed ontology with commitment relations.
An interpretation of ( ,  ), <{ i}i I,{rij}i,j I>, satisfies   and  , iff

 The commutability constraint (CC) is satisfied: If <Oi, Oj> ,  V(Oi) and k =  ( ) Then rkj( k) = rij(rki( k)) If <Oi, Oj> , then rij is an embedded identity relation.
When an interpretation of ( ,  ) satisfies   and  , we call it an interpretation of ( ,  ,  ,  ).
The complete commitment relationship is introduced to formalize the owl:imports mechanism.
Example 3.
(Revisit example 2) Furthermore, suppose O2 commits to O1.
We will derive that A is equivalent to C in O2.
Due to the commitment of O2 to O1,  (C)=2, by (CC), we have r22(C 2) ==== r12(r21(C 2)), so we have C 2 ==== r12(r21(C 2))
 Together with (E21) and (E22), we have C 2   r12(A 1)   r12(r21(C 2) ==== C 2 So we have C 2 ==== r12(A 1) (i.e. A 2), then it is concluded that EquivalentClasses(A C) in O2.
But we still can t obtain that EquivalentClasses(A C) in O1 unless O1 commits to O2.
That s the intended effect of the commitment.
As a try to clarify some of the URI meaning issues, this paper proposes the notion of agreement on vocabulary provenance and the notion of commitment between ontologies, and presents a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies, which is based on local models semantics approach, and extends it to cope with the URI sharing by harmonizing the local models via provenance agreement and possible commitment relationships.
As compared to COWL [1], our approach has more flexibility, and fits in with the principle of Web architecture.
In addition, our approach defines the complete commitment relationship as a special sub-relation of commitment relationship to formalize the owl:import mechanism, in other words, our approach extends it to cope with more general distributed ontologies.
However, more research work should be taken to deal with the reasoning issue within our semantic framework.
Another work is to extend the OWL DL with some constructs representing the vocabulary provenance as well as the commitment relationship.
