Several approaches to automatically generate Web recommendations based on user s Web navigation patterns or ratings exist.
Some involve learning a usage model from Web access data or from user ratings.
For example, lazy modeling is used in collaborative filtering which simply stores all users  information and then relies on K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) to provide recommendations from the previous history of similar users.
Frequent itemsets, session clusters, or user profiles can also form a user model obtained using data mining.
Pazzani and Billsus [3] presented a collaborative filtering approach based on users  ratings of web pages, and Naives Bayes as the prediction tool.
Mobasher et al. [1] use pre-discovered association rules and an efficient data structure to provide recommendations based on web navigation patterns.
Among the most popular methods, the ones based on collaborative filtering and the ones based on fixed support association rule discovery may be the most difficult and expensive to use.
This is because, for the case of high-dimensional and extremely sparse Web data, it is difficult to set suitable support and confidence thresholds to yield reliable and complete web usage patterns.
Similarly, collaborative models may struggle with sparse data, and do not scale well to the number of users.

(CUSA-2-step-Rec) Our approach is based on first extracting user profiles or ratings using a method, such as Web usage mining.
In this case, the profile discovery can be executed offline by mining user access log files using the following steps: (1) Preprocess log file to extract user sessions, (2) Categorize sessions by clustering, (3) Summarize the session categories in terms of user profiles, After automatically grouping sessions into different clusters, we summarize the session categories in terms of user profile vectors, pi: The kth component/weight of this vector (pik) captures the relevance of URLk in the ith profile, as estimated by the conditional probability that URLk is accessed in a session belonging to the ith cluster (this is the frequency with which URLk was accessed in the sessions belonging to the ith cluster).
The recommendation problem can be stated as follows.
Given a current Web user session vector, sj = [sj1, sj2,  , sjNU], predict the set of URLs that are most relevant according to the user s interest, and recommend them to the user, usually as a set of links dynamically appended to the response to the most recent request.
We denote the recommendations for current Web session, sj, by a vector rj = [rj1, rj2,  , rjNU], where rjk = 1 if the kth URL is recommended, and 0 otherwise.
A multilayer perceptron neural network can be used to directly predict the URLs to be given as recommendations.
Each training input consists of a user sub-session (ss) derived from a ground-truth complete session S, while the output nodes should conform to the remainder of this session (S-ss).
This means that there is one output and one input node per URL.
Hence, the architecture of the network can become extremely complex, as there would be NU input and NU output nodes.
Training such a network may prove to be unrealistic on large websites.
To overcome this problem, a separate network is learned for each profile independently.
Thus, the number of input and output nodes depends only on the number of significant URLs in that profile, and possibly those related to its URLs by conceptual similarity.
There is a committee of specialized networks, one per profile, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Each of these networks is specialized for one profile, hence offering a locally refined model.
The network of each profile is learnt independently with a separate set of training data.
Learning each network involves presenting the URLs visited by users belonging to
 that profile as input and learning the network weights that yield an activation value of 1 in the output units that correspond to the remaining URLs of the session, and 0 otherwise.
At test-time, the output units generate URL recommendations after applying a threshold of  0.5  to the output activations.

 Hopfield networks are a special kind of recurrent neural networks that can be used as associative memory.
A Hopfield network can retrieve a complete pattern stored through the training process from an imperfect or noisy version of it.
In some sense, a recommender system performs a similar operation, when it recommends certain URLs from an incomplete session.
Given Nurl fully connected (via symmetric weights wij between each two units i and j) neurons, each serving simultaneously as input and as output, and assuming that the activation values, xi, are bipolar (+1/-1), the optimal weights to memorize Np patterns, can be determined by Hebbian learning as follows w ij = pN   p =
 for all i   (0, otherwise) j xx p i p j During testing/recall, when a new noisy pattern xnew is presented as 0 = xnew-i, input, we set the activation at node i at iteration 0 to be xi then the units are adjusted by iteratively computing, at each iteration t x t i
 + = url  
 = j
 xw ij t j until the network converges to a stable state.
However, the desired behavior of recall in a Hopfield network is expected to hold only if all the possible complete session prototypes can be stored in the Hopfield network s connection weights, and if these complete interact (or cross-talk) excessively.
Severe sessions do not deterioration starts occurring when the number of patterns Np >
 large number of URLs and yet very little variety in the user access patterns.
This limitation is paradoxical in the context of large websites or transactional database systems.
Our preliminary simulations with both a single global Hopfield network as well as several profile-specific Hopfield networks have resulted in low recall qualities since the network seemed to be able to memorize only very few stable states.
However several profile-specific Hopfield networks perform better than one global network.
university Web server, were used to generate training and testing sets.
For each complete session considered as the ground-truth, all possible sub-sessions of different sizes are generated.
The test dataset forms an independent 20% of the sub-sessions.
Hierarchical Unsupervised Niche Clustering (H-UNC) [2] partitioned the web sessions into 20 clusters, each characterized by one of 20 profile vectors.
We trained each neural network using back propagation with a maximum number of epochs =
 hidden to output layer, and Momentum = 0.5.
The Collaborative filtering approach is based on using K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) followed by top-N recommendations for different values of K and N.
Figure 3 shows the k-NN s 20-profile average of precision, coverage, and F1 measure (we show K=50, N=10, which gave the best results).
A comparison with Fig. 2 shows that the profile-specific URL-predictor neural network recommender system wins in terms of both better precision and better coverage, particularly above session size 2.
The k-NN also yields reasonably accurate predictions.
However, k-NN is its high computational and memory costs at notorious recommendation time.

 Several separate and smaller URL-predictor neural networks, specialized to each profile, help provide a more refined context-aware personalization, while making training faster than global (all-profiles) neural network predictors because only the URLs relevant to one profile are used to define the network architecture.
The CUSA-2-step-Rec is hybrid, mixing people-to-people (in step 1) and item-to-item (in step 2) recommendations, which may explain its superior performance.
