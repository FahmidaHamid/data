We developed a process for presenting diagrammatic information on the World Wide Web while making that information available to a search and inference engine.
If done right, this makes the information easier to read for people [2].
However, information presented in an image file is not accessible to search engines.
While a search engine may be able to use the image tags and surrounding text to make an educated guess about what an image represents, in the case of diagrams (as compared to photos) it is particularly desirable to be able to search and reason with the information contained within the image.
Diagrammatic inference systems are special-purpose systems.
They differ from first-order logic in that they are custom-fit for the domain for which they are intended.
This means that they are limited to that domain, but they are usually complete [3, 4, 5].
See [1] for an encompassing treatment of these issues.
In the following example, we show the format of an XML document in our system and how it relates to the rendered image.
Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
Figure 1 contains the XML file and figure 2 the rendered image.
Data is boldfaced.
The top level element is chart and contains a single attribute type with which to specify the chart type, which can be a bar, line, or pie-chart.
In this example, we show a bar chart.
The chart's title is contained in the title element and is displayed above the chart proper.
The title not only assists the human viewer in identifying the kind of information presented, the search engine will also rely heavily on the information in it.
1 <?xml version="1.0" ?> <chart type="bar"> <title>4-Year GPA by Gender</title> <legend /> <plotarea> <axis variable= x1 >Year</axis> <axis variable= x2  min="0" max="4.0" step="0.5">GPA</axis> </plotarea> <dataset label="Men"> <datapoint x1="2000" x2="2.6" /> <datapoint x1="2001" x2="2.8" /> <datapoint x1="2002" x2="2.9" /> <datapoint x1="2003" x2="3.0" /> </dataset> <dataset label="Women"> <datapoint x1="2000" x2="2.5" /> <datapoint x1="2001" x2="2.8" /> <datapoint x1="2002" x2="3.0" /> <datapoint x1="2003" x2="3.1" /> </dataset> </chart> Figure 1.
A sample XML file for a bar chart.
A legend element enables the user to specify (by its presence or absence) whether a legend should be generated in the resulting image.
The actual label information is pulled from the dataset elements, as described below.
The information enclosed in the plotarea element is of technical as well as semantic nature.
Currently, our system only renders two dimensional charts, designated by variable attributes with the values "x1" and "x2".
The text contained within an axis element is used to label it.
For a bar chart, the x2-axis specifies a starting and ending value (min and max attribute) as well as a gradation for the vertical axis (step attribute).
In contrast, the horizontal x1-axis does not contain these attributes and is instead divided based on the string data present in the x1

contain numerical data and hence would look like the x2-axis of the example.
In contrast, a pie chart has no axes and has no need of a plotarea element.

The results of a query requesting inference.
A search engine enables a user to find information that is explicitly contained in a document.
An inference engine enables a user to also search for information that is implicitly contained in the document.
For example, the highest GPA achieved by women is 3.1.
Furthermore, the GPA went up each year.
Those two results are indicated in the search displayed in figure 3.
They are two pieces of information that people looking at bar-charts are very interested in.
We implemented those two inference rules, as well as rules for minimum, average, median, decreasing and those that compare datapoints to a given values.
We feel that those predicates are central to charts of our system, and are sufficient for now.
Our system of storing chart information in XML files on the web demonstrates a general process by which diagrammatic information can be stored on a web server in sentential format without losing the preferred visual presentation of the information to the user.
The primary benefit of this process is that what the user perceives as an image is in fact a text file that can be indexed by a typical search engine spider.
The choice of an XML format reaps the additional benefit of having structured metadata, as demonstrated in the design of our diagrammatic search and inference engine.
