The most successful Web search techniques, PageRank [2] and HITS [6], exploit the hyperlink structure of the Web to find quality pages such as  authorities  and  hubs  [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
However, an important factor that is not considered by these techniques is the timeliness of search results.
In this paper, we study search from the temporal dimension.
This dimension is essential when users look for the latest information.
We believe that the temporal dimension of search is of great importance to the future developments of search technology.
In this paper, we take the first step towards this direction.
We investigate this problem in the context of research publication search [8] because of two reasons.
First of all, results in the research publication domain can be objectively evaluated, as all the Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
citation data of the paper collection are available.
Secondly, concepts in both academic citation and Web domains are largely the same.
For example, a research paper corresponds to a Web page, and a citation of a research paper corresponds to a hyperlink in a Web page.
We present a number of methods to incorporate time dimension in paper search.
These methods are evaluated experimentally.
The results show that the proposed methods are highly effective.
There are many factors that contribute to the potential importance of a paper, such as the citations it has received, the date of these citations, its authors, and the publication journal.
PageRank only includes the first factor, the citations that a paper receives.
To integrate the time dimension, we add timing factors in the PageRank and propose the TimedPageRank algorithm.
Since we are interested in both a paper s current importance and its potential, we modify PageRank by weighting each citation according to the citation date.
The system calculates the time-weighted PageRank (PRT) value for each paper as follows:


 )(  =
 d ) wd  + (
  

 pC (
 ( ) p
 ) w n ++ ...
 
 pC (
 n ( ) p n ) ) (1) where PRT(A) is the time-weighted PageRank score of paper A, PRT(pi) is the time-weighted PageRank score of paper pi that links to paper A, C(pi) is the number of outbound links of paper pi and d is a damping factor, which is set to 0.85.
Equation (1) is a modified version of the original PageRank.
In this equation, we introduced the timed weight for each citation, wi.
Its value reduces exponentially with the citation age; the base of the exponential function is DecayRate.
DecayRate is a parameter (we use 0.5 in our experiments).
Note that if DecayRate is 1, the time-weighted PageRank algorithm will be the same as the original PageRank algorithm.
In addition, the DecayRate parameter can be tuned according to the nature of a dataset/the user.
After the current importance of a paper is evaluated, we also want to know how the importance changes in the future year.
Our experimental data show an obvious trend that a new paper is more likely to draw citations than an old paper.
Therefore, another parameter called the agingfactor, Aging(A) (which is in [0, 1]), is introduced.
In our experiments a brand new paper s agingfactor is 1.
After the publication, it declines linearly with

 time, and its range is from 0.5 to 1.
Thus, a paper A s final TimedPageRank (TPR) is computed as follows: TPR(A)= Aging(A) * PRT(A) (2)
 Although TimedPageRank is able to boost the rank of emerging quality papers, it is not sufficient for all the papers because new papers only have a few or no citation.
To assess the potential importance of a new paper, its source information, its authors and the journal, are useful.
We compute author evaluation by averaging the time-weighted PageRank values of all the past papers of the author, and journal evaluation by averaging the time-weighted PageRank values of all the papers published in the journal.
We can evaluate paper based on its journal evaluation, or its author evaluation, or the combination of both.
Another simple technique that can be used to rank a paper is linear regression.
That is, one can use citation count of the paper received in the past few years to perform a linear regression to predict the citation count in the coming year.
This predicted citation count can be used as the score of the paper for final ranking.
This method is fairly straightforward and will not be discussed further.
Similar to TimedPageRank technique, linear regression will not be accurate if a paper is published only recently, and has only a few or no citation.
In this case, we again used author and journal evaluation to score the new paper.
In this case, author or journal evaluation can be done by using actual citation counts of all the papers of the author or journal.
After they are computed, we can use the journal evaluation, or the author evaluation, or the combination of both to make the final source evaluation.
In our experiments, we used the research publication dataset from the KDD CUP 2003.
The documents are from an archive of High Energy Particle Physics publications.
Our system ranks the papers that are relevant to a given query and presents to the user.
For the purpose of this research, we assume that a paper is relevant to a query as long as it contains all the query words.
We experimented with 25 queries.
To evaluate the performance of proposed techniques, we do not compare their rankings directly.
Instead, we compare the number of citations that the top ranking papers receive in the following year to evaluate our algorithms.
Table 1 presents the experiment results.
Only the results for the top 30 papers are given.
The results are presented in 3 rows.
Each row gives the total citation counts for a group of top papers based on different evaluation methods.
Column 2 gives the total citation count for each group of retrieved top papers by Original PageRank for all 25 queries, Column 3 gives the ratio of the total citation count for this method and the total citation count of the ideal ranking (called best citation count given in Column 12).
Similar to columns 2 and 3, column pairs, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, and 10-11 show the citation counts of retrieved papers, and the citation percentage for different techniques respectively.
From the data in table 1, we can draw the conclusion that both TimedPageRank and Linear Regression perform significantly better than the original PageRank.
Moreover, the author and journal evaluation is helpful in improving the prediction results in most cases.
This paper studies the temporal dimension of search.
So far, little research work has been done to consider time in either publication search or Web search.
In this paper, we made an attempt to study this problem.
A number of techniques to remedy the situation were proposed.
Experiments have also been conducted to evaluate these techniques.
Our results show that the proposed techniques are highly effective.
Furthermore, the proposed methods can be conveniently adapted to Web search because concepts in the two domains are largely parallel.
In our future work, we plan to conduct this research.
