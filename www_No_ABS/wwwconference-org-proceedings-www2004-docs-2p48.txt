The growing standardization, acceptance, and diffusion of novel devices (e.g., PDA, Smartphones) and network infrastructures (e.g.
WiFi, UMTS, Bluetooth) require an overall shift of the paradigms for design and development of traditional information systems in order to enable the access of services from users exploiting several distinct technologies.
In other words, traditional information systems are evolving to multichannel information systems in which a service is provided on several distinct channels, being the latter an abstraction of the network infrastructure and of the device used to access a service.
At a high level of abstraction, channel examples are: a simple PC connected to the service provider through the Internet, a PDA connected equipped with a wireless LAN network interface, a SmartPhone exploiting UMTS and a private backbone.
The Italian MAIS project (Multichannel Adaptive Information Sys-tems)1 focuses on the study of models, methodologies, and tools for the design and development of this class of forthcoming systems.

In particular de ning, providing, certifying, and monitoring quality of service in a multichannel information systems is one of the MAIS project objectives.
Research on these topics is motivated by observing that in a multichannel information system the quality of a given service as perceived by users (i.e., end-to-end QoS) strictly depends on the channels used to access the service, i.e. on the quality of networks and devices, other than on the quality of the service itself.
As an example, let us consider a Video-on-Demand (VoD) service, allowing users to watch a video stream using both  typical  devices and networks (e.g.
a Pc connected to a wired network), as well as innovative wireless and mobile device (e.g., PDAs, Smart-Phones)2.
In this context, and especially for chargeable services, it is highly desirable to provide users with some guarantees about end-to-end QoS, in order to enable service selection and comparison not only on the basis of functional requirements, but also using information about nonfunctional aspects of the service.
This requires service providers to carefully evaluate how the QoS they are able to offer on the basis of their internal resources is modi ed along the path connecting the user to the service itself.
To this aim, we deem it necessary to develop a clean quality model that enables reasoning on how channels (and associated providers) affect nonfunctional aspects of a service.
Once such a model is available, services can be labelled with end-to-end QoS information, thus enabling QoS-enhanced service offering (by providers) and service lookup (by users) in a multichannel adaptive information system.
In addition, a quality model puts the basis for quality certi cation and monitoring.
In particular, by clearly stating how each metric is affected by service, network, and device providers, the proposed model supports the de nition of metrics, monitoring means, and responsibilities of service level enforcement within a service level agreement framework [27].
Finally, the model supports the design of user-side and provider-side channel adaptation strategies based on QoS [21], i.e., user criteria to trigger channel switches upon detecting unsatisfactory levels of quality while accessing the service from a given channel, or provider suggestions about channel switches for maximizing user quality, respectively.
In this paper we present a quality model for multichannel information systems.
This model is composed by a system model and by a set of roles and rules that the elements of the system model respect and use to enable the eventual evaluation of end-to-end QoS.
cently launched on the European marketplace from relevant cellular phones network operators in preparation to the advent of UMTS and are being frequently advertised, e.g., in the soccer game domain.
nels according to its preferences (de ned in the pro le), by stating, for instance, that when all the channels are available it prefers to use the PC when it stays at home.
The service provider and the service user, before the service provisioning starts, have to agree on a contract concerning the quality of the provided services.
In particular, the contract should de ne which is the quality level of the service provided in terms of availability, data quality, security and so on.
Other entries of the contract should de ne which are the available channels through which the service may be invoked, or which is the device the user is going to use.
During service execution, the service provider is in charge of maintaining what stated in the contract.
For this matter, it relies on monitoring strategies and adaptivity policies that are able to discover contract unful llment and to consequently enact the suitable adaptation policies.
In order to allow for adaptivity from the provider standpoint, services are provided using a re ective architecture [18] that handles the underlying resources in order to enabling the suitable policies to maintain a pre-de ned service level.
On the contrary, from a user standpoint, the adaptation is not motivated by the contract but by his own requirements with respect to his pro le.
Quality of service and related issues have been the topic of several researches and standardization efforts crossing distinct communities during the last years.
For the purposes of this work, it is worth mentioning the web and web-service community (e.g., [25, 20, 29]), the networking and internetworking communities (e.g., [12, 13, 7, 11]) as well as the middleware community (e.g., [30,
 at least intended (i) to identify the relevant measurable characteristics affecting the quality of the services provided by a given  object  (e.g., a web-service, a network infrastructure, a middleware platform) and (ii) to de ne means (e.g.
architectures, paradigms, components, and protocols) to implement an  object  whose values of its measurable characteristics satisfy some quantitative constraints.
We name the measurable characteristics of objects QoS parameters3.
For instance, focusing on the web-service community, [20] iden-ti es the QoS parameters deemed useful for service providers to characterize the services.
In some sense, [25] integrates this proposal devising means to extend service discovery on the basis of QoS-related information in addition to interfaces.
[29] proposes a methodology enabling the evaluation of the overall QoS of a composite service, i.e., a service obtained by composing several distinct services, provided that a description of the QoS parameters of the component services is available.
Unfortunately, several of such parameters (e.g., availability, performance, and so on) are dif cult to de ne and to evaluate in an end-to-end manner since the networks or the devices used to let a service and users interact are even partially out of the control of the provider.
For this matter, in these proposals services are labelled by providers with a set of parameters in order to enable ordering and selecting them on the basis of QoS.
This approach is limited when considering that usually the QoS perceived by users depends on factors out of the control of the provider, e.g., service availability depends on (i) provider availability, (ii) network availability, and (iii) user device availability.
To address this kind of issues, [28] introduces the relevant dis-
topic, e.g.
dimension, attributes [9].
Figure 1: User perspective In particular, in the system model we identify the main objects (services, networks, devices) and actors (service, network, and device providers) of multichannel information system.
According to the model, actors coordinate their activities within communities to obtain speci cations.
The basic idea underlying the quality model is thus to extend speci cations of objects with the quality information necessary to evaluate end-to-end QoS.
Further, roles de ne who is responsible of de ning quality parameters and quality sets for each object and each speci cation, while rules dictate how to combine quality sets associated to services, networks, and devices to evaluate end-to-end QoS.
Finally, we show how the quality model supports QoS-enhanced service offering and lookup.
We support the presentation using a running example, i.e., the implementation of a VoD service in a multichannel information system.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section
 related work; Section 4 illustrates the quality model; Section 5 sketches an application example;  nally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
A preliminary analysis of the issues related to service provisioning in a multichannel environment straightly drives to the necessity of de ning channels and their interactions with the two main actors it serves, i.e., the service provider and the service user.
Figure
 out the main issues we face.
Starting from the channel, using a simpli ed version of [23], it is de ned as a pair hnetwork, devicei, where device characterizes the user s equipment (e.g., PDA, PC, SmartPhone), and network identi es the set of devices interconnecting the provider and the user device.
Concerning the service provider, he is described in terms of the provided services.
In particular, besides the traditional de nition in which the performed functionalities are considered, a service is also de ned by the set of channels used to carry the service information.
On the other channel side, the user is characterized by a context and by a pro le [5].
The context describes, among the others, the set of channels available and the channel currently in use, in a given location and at a given time.
The pro le captures user preferences that depend on a role held by the user, its expertise on the service, and a set of generic preferences that enable further service-speci c user pro ling.

Evidences of this important distinction are presented in [17], experimentally showing that the QoE of a user sur ng the web using a browser through an Internet Service Provider is lightly affected by network latency and highly affected by network bandwidth.
Similar work, e.g., [26], show how to relate QoS of service and network providers to QoE for speci c services and applications.
In other words, QoE can be expressed as the user perception of end-to-end QoS [3].
Putting the basis for evaluating QoE of services is a  rst class issue, as it would allow coping quite straightforwardly with other relevant issues such as (i) the de ni-tion of service level agreements [27, 16] based on the actual quality of service perceived by users, (ii) the clear and unambiguous assignment of responsibilities for enforcing each quality parameter value (and to possibly de ne the corresponding penalties in case of unsatisfactory levels) [24, 14], and (ii) the de nition of integrated architectures among service, network, and device providers, cooperating to enforce QoE parameters [19, 15].
The quality model consists of (i) a system model de ning objects and actors, and of (ii) a set of roles and rules enabling the association of quality information to objects.
Quality information is expressed using quality parameters and quality sets.
The proposed system model is based on the service oriented architecture (SOA, [10, 4]), which is extended with an explicit representation of channels (i.e, networks and devices) to  t multichannel information systems.
As a consequence, the SOA basic infrastructure based on service providers, service requestors, and service directories, is augmented with networks, devices, and associated actors.
Figure 2 illustrates the main concepts of the resulting systems model, consisting of objects, actors, communities, and speci cations, described below.
Objects.
Services, networks, and devices are the  rst class objects of our system model.
They are handled by actors and speci ed by communities, i.e., an object is the implementation of a speci cation de ned by some community (see below).
In particular, a service is a software entity performing operations that can be characterized by a service speci cation de ning its functionalities.
Several proposals address the problem of expressing such a functional spec-i cation through a standard language (e.g., WSDL [6], DAML-S [8]).
A network abstracts the set of devices used to transport messages between a service provider and the user device, which may include several subnetworks, routers, gateways, and other devices and could be characterized by the interface offered to devices (e.g.,
 that may connect to the network.
A device is the user mean for exploiting services, and it consists of a set of input and output interfaces that enable interactions with users (e.g., keyboard, display), and by a set of network interfaces (e.g., supporting 802.3, 802.11, GPRS, UMTS) enabling the connection to a network.
Actors.
Actors are entities responsible of performing actions on objects or interested in the execution of some operations.
In particular, according to the service-oriented architecture [10], service providers publish the speci cations of the provided services within a public registry (e.g., a UDDI registry [2]), maintained by the service directory.
Network providers offer networking services and manage the underlying network infrastructure, e.g., cellular phone companies, Internet Service Providers (ISP).
Device producers model industries producing devices as PDAs, PCs, SmartPhones, and so on.
Users, using the service directory, are able to select, to locate, and to invoke services by analyzing functional speci cations.
Communities and speci cations.

Therefore a community is a group of actors which aims at proposing a speci cation for a group of objects with some relevant common characteristics.
An actor in the community implements objects compliant to the speci cation de ned by the community.
In particular, service providers standardize the minimum functional speci cation a service must implement to be included into a particular service community (e.g., the VoD community).
In other words, a service community can be characterized by a minimum service spec-i cation.
Network communities de ne the main characteristics of networks through network speci cations.
Analogously, providers of similar devices identify a minimum set of features (e.g., display size, color depth, audio capabilities, and network interfaces) that members of a device community must support.
As mentioned above, the quality model must enable association of quality information to objects.
This is achieved extending spec-i cations with quality information using quality parameters, sets and rules for composing them, described below.
A quality parameter models relevant and measurable nonfunctional aspects of an object.
Quality sets are compounds of quality parameters that can be associated to objects.
Quality rules de ne how to combine quality sets associated to distinct objects to evaluate their global effects on their nonfunctional aspects.
In the following, we introduce the notation deemed necessary to deal with these concepts.
Quality parameters.
A quality parameter qp is a pair qp = hname, admissible valuesi where name identi es the parameter and admissible values is an ordered set of typed values within which the parameter is admitted to vary.
Examples of quality parameters are: hbandwidth, [1Kps..512Kps]i hencryption, [40bit; 64bit; 128bit]i hresolution, [320   200; 800   600; 1024   768; 1240   748]i, hlatency, [10ms...500ms]i.
Given a quality parameter qp, qp.name returns the name  eld, and qp.values returns the admissible values.
Further, the functions best(name) and worst(name) are introduced to evaluate the admissible value corresponding to the best and the worst quality of a quality parameter qp : qp.name = name, respectively.
The values of these functions clearly depends on the semantics of the parameter, e.g.
best(bandwidth) = 512Kbps, best(latency) = 10ms.
Quality sets.
Quality sets are classes of quality parameters.
Given a quality set QS, QS.names returns the set of names of the quality parameters belonging to q.
We say that a quality set QS2 is contained within a quality set QS1 (QS1   QS2) iff (i) QS1 and QS2 have the same set of names, i.e. QS1.names = QS2.names, and (ii) each quality parameter in Q1 has admissible values ranging within the admissible values of the corresponding parameter in Q2, i.e.  qp1   QS1, qp2   QS2, qp1.name = qp2.name   qp1.values   qp2.values.
Quality sets can be associated to both objects and speci cations.
Therefore, provided that object O is the implementation of a speci cation S, we distinguish between speci- cation quality sets (S.QS) and object quality sets (O.QS).
Using S.QS a community de nes relevant quality parameters and their Figure 3: Example of the effect of containment between quality sets admissible values.
These values represent all the possible values that any object implementing the speci cation can offer.
As a consequence we require that if O implements (or is compliant to) S, then O.QS is contained within S.QS.
Figure 3 illustrates the effect of containment between quality sets on the framerate quality parameter of a VoD service (expressed in frame per seconds - fps).
Quality rules.
Actors and communities  rst associate quality parameters and sets to objects and speci cations, and then they relate quality sets using quality rules.
A quality rule can be de ned as follows: given two quality sets QS1, QS2, a quality rule for QS1 on QS2 is a function qr12(QS1, QS2) = QS3 such that: (i) QS3 is a quality set, and (ii) QS3 is contained in QS1.
This implies that independently from the set of quality parameters of QS2, QS3 has parameters whose names are the same of those contained in QS1 and whose values are contained in the corresponding parameters of QS1.
Indeed, these rules are used to model the effects on the quality parameters of an object/speci cation A having a quality set QS1 when it is coupled with another object/speci cation B having a quality set QS2, i.e., to evaluate how the quality of A is affected by B.
Further, we require that quality rules satisfy the following containment property: if qr12(QS1, QS2) = QS3 is a

 quality rule, then for any QS0
 qr12(QS0 easy to see that the quality rule containment property implies that if a quality rule is de ned among speci cation quality sets, it can be used to evaluate effects on quality of the corresponding object implementations.
Remarks.
The main objective of the quality model is to analyze how the relationships among the elements of a multichannel information system affect the quality perceived by users.
To this aim, the containment relationship forces actors to implement objects with quality attributes compliant to the speci cation, while quality rules (which have a similar containment relationship) dictate how to evaluate quality modi cations of a service upon varying the channel used to access the service itself.
Further, being the focus on relationships, we do not enter the details of a language for specifying quality parameters and sets, and we limit to mention a good candidate, i.e., the Quality Modelling Language (QML, [9]).
Exploiting quality parameters, sets, and rules communities and actors operate in two different stages, namely the speci cation de -nition phase and the object implementation phase, in order to specify quality aspects of objects and speci cations and to analyze their relationships.
In particular,  rst communities de ne the speci cation quality sets for services, networks, and devices.
Once these
 each actor can produce objects compliant to speci cations according to the containment relationships, can de ne quality rules enabling to evaluate the end-to-end quality of a service for each channel, and in particular service providers can evaluate information on the end-to-end quality of service as a function of the channel on which the service is provided.
Communities roles.
During the speci cation de nition phase, communities are in charge of de ning quality speci cations (i.e., quality sets).
In particular, communities identify the name and the admissible values of all the quality attributes identifying all the relevant measurable nonfunctional aspects of any object that will comply to the speci cation.
In particular, (i) each service community associates to each service the service speci cation quality set (S.QSQoS), (ii) each network community associates to each network the network speci cation quality set (S.QSQoN ), and (iii) each device community associates to each device the device spec-i cation quality set (S.QSQoD).
Examples of these speci cations can be found in [13, 7] for networks, and in [1] for devices.
Concerning services, we remark that current proposals, e.g., [25, 29, 24], commonly model nonfunctional aspects of services (e.g.
per formance, availability, and so on), assuming either that they can be evaluated almost independently from networks and devices or including the end-to-end effects of a single channel within the service quality set speci cation.
In both cases, they result not suitable for multichannel information systems.
It is also important to note that quality parameters in the service speci cation quality set shall not consider channels and end-to-end aspects.
For example, the service response time should be the time elapsed to produce a reply since the arrival of a request at the provider site; analogously, service availability should be evaluated at the provider site without considering network and device effects.
This feature highly simpli es the de nition of these service speci cations.
For each quality parameter identi ed, the communities set the limits of admissible value to values which include all the possible values independently from the implementation.
When precise values cannot be identi ed, both or one of the two admissible value limits can be set to  .
For example, the VoD community, according to the video encoding softwares now available, can set the admissible value of the framerate quality parameter in the VoD speci cation to [5f ps..40f ps].
On the contrary, considering the latency, the network community de ne the admissible value as [0sec.. +  ] since some implementation could be follow a best effort approach about this parameter.
Finally, a service community can relate the speci cation quality set S.QSQoS of a service with speci cation S to a set of channels.
To attain this, for each channel ci = hN, Di, the community de nes a quality rule qrs,ci (S.QSQoS, qrn,d(S.QSQoN , S.QDQoD)) Due to the quality rule containment property and to the quality set containment relationship, such a quality rule enables every service provider, aiming to offer a service with speci cation S on channel ci, to evaluate the end-to-end QoS.
This evaluation is obtained by simply substituting the object quality sets O.QSQoS, O.QSQoN , and O.QSQoD within the rule, provided that object quality sets are contained within those of the corresponding speci cation, i.e. O.QSQoS   S.QSQoS, O.QSQoN   S.QSQoN , and O.QSQoD   S.QSQoD.
In order to de ne quality rules, communities exploit engineering knowledge, e.g., physical dependencies among quality parameters.
As example, the bandwidth parameter of networks signi cantly affects the framerate, color depth and resolution quality parameters of a VoD service which are also affected by the colors quality parameters of a device.
Actors roles.
During the object implementation phase, actors implement objects compliant to speci cations and associate them object quality sets that satisfy containment relationships with the corresponding speci cation.
Adhering to speci cations is important to let service providers evaluate end-to-end QoS using (i) their object quality sets, and (ii) the set of quality rules dictated by the service community (if any) as described above.
Let us note that  adhering to speci cations  in our vision is equivalent to say that object quality sets are included in speci cation quality sets.
To attain this, it is enough to let values of quality parameters of speci cation quality sets vary in interval suf ciently large for any possible implementation.
Note also that if there is no quality rule for given a channel on which the provider aims to offer a service, the actor is free to de ne a quality rule for the channel and to propose it to the service community for approval.
Therefore we can assume that exploiting the proposed model, service provider are eventually able to label service with the quality that will be perceived by users accessing the services from all the channels over which the service is provided.
Remarks.
A relevant issue about the proposed quality model concerns the quality of its instances, this meaning answering the following question:  How good is this instance of the quality model in capturing quality aspects of this particular multichannel information system? .
Answering this question relates to the attention paid by communities and actors in de ning quality sets and quality rules.
In this sense, the proposed model is a  rst step whose main contribution is in enabling the creation of good instances by a clear de nition of the underlying system model, tools and responsibilities.
The process to build instances of the proposed model is applied to a case-study in the following section.
The focus of this section is to sketch the use of the quality model presented in this paper mainly in order to clarify the phases and tools introduced.
Figure 2 shows all the main objects and actors used in this example.
As aforementioned, the Video-on-Demand is a service that allows a user to watch to video-streams on several heterogeneous devices, e.g.
traditional PCs and SmartPhones.
Let us remark that this service has been recently introduced in the European mobile phones marketplace and currently provides users with short streams containing relevant pieces of football matches.
Therefore, in this simple example, the communities involved are: the VoD service community (SC), the network community N C, and two device communities (P CC for the PCs and SM C for the SmartPhones).
First of all, recall that the model assumes that communities de- ne the functional speci cations and identify the set of quality parameters deemed relevant with respect to the services they provide.
Therefore we assume communities to de ne the following quality sets.
SC de nes the quality set V oDspec.QSQoS as follows: V oDspec.QSQoS = {hf ramerate, [5f ps..40f ps]i, hcolordepth, [2bit..24bit]i, hresolution, [320   200; 800   600; 1024   768]i} N C de nes the quality set M yN etspec.QSQoN as follows: M yN etspec.QSQoN = {hbandwidth, [10Kbps...512Kbps]i, hloss, [0..0.01]i, hlatency, [5ms..500ms]i} P CC de nes the quality set P cspec.QSQoD as follows: P cspec.QSQoD = {hcolors, [2..24bit]i, hnw int, [802.11b; 802.3]i}
 lows: SmartP honespec.QSQoD = {hweight, [150gr..300gr]i, hcolors, [2..16bit]i, hnw int, [GP RS; U M T S; GSM ]i} Communities are also responsible of de ning the quality rules relating quality parameters.
These rules originates from the analysis of the physical dependencies among the service, network, and device parameters.
Considering the VoD example, and considering very simpli ed versions of the actual mathematical relationships, it is possible to state that: f ramerate ?
colordepth ?
resolution = K ?
bandwidth According to this relationship we can also identify the following relationships which affects the admissible range of the quality parameters.
best(f ramerate) = best(bandwidth) worst(colordepth) ?
worst(resolution) worst(f ramerate) = worst(bandwidth) best(colordepth) ?
best(resolution) best(colordepth) = minimum(best(colors), best(colordepth)) worst(qoe.colordepth) = minimum(worst(colors), worst(colordepth)) With similar reasonings, it is possible to derive how each service quality parameter is affected by (i) channel quality parameters and (ii) device quality parameters, i.e. to de ne quality rules.
Therefore we abstract out from the detailed sequence of steps taking to the precise derivation of quality rules, which are the main objectives of some ongoing works.
We limit to mention that observing mathematical relationships as those described above, it is possible to precisely characterize these rules.
In particular, it is possible to evaluate two end-to-end quality rules, namely qr1() and qr2(), that take a service quality set as input parameter and return the service quality perceived by users accessing the service through network M yN et and using either a PC or a smartphone, respectively.
Let us now suppose that four different actors (namely, a service provider S1, a network provider N1, a PC provider D1, and a smartphone provider D2) implement all the speci cations described above.
According to actor roles, besides the implementation of the functional speci cation, actors are in charge of de ning an object quality set that satis es the containment property with respect to related speci- cation.
Therefore we assume these providers to de ne the following object quality sets.
S1 de nes the S1.QSQoS quality set as follows: S1.QSQoS = {hf ramerate, [5f ps..30f ps]i, hcolordepth, [2bit..24bit]i, hresolution, [320   200; 800   600]i} N1 de nes the N1.QSQoN quality set as follows: N1.QSQoN = {hbandwidth, [10Kbps...128Kbps]i, hloss, [0..0.01]i, hlatency, [10ms..500ms]i} D1 de nes the D1.QSQoD quality set as follows: D1.QSQoD = {hcolors, [2..24bit]i, hnw int, [802.3]i} D2 de nes the D2.QSQoD quality set as follows: D2.SmartP honespec.QSQoD = {hweight, [170gr..180gr]i, hcolors, [2..8bit]i, hnw int, [U M T S]i} These speci cations, together with the quality rules qr1 and qr2, allow the user to derive the end-to-end quality of service for each available channel.
Note that, in this simple example, the admissible channels are two (obtained combining network M yN et with the devices D1 and D2).
For each of these channels the user can evaluate how the service quality set S1.QSQoS is perceived through these channels applying the quality functions.
Such an evaluation generates, for each channel, a new quality set Ui.QSQoS   S1.QSQoS (i identi es the channel).
Note that Ui.QSQoS is composed by the same quality parameters belonging to S1.QSQoS with an admissible range restricted if necessary.
Let us also  nally remark that the same evaluation can be performed by service providers in order to provide users with a precise characterization of the actual end-to-end quality of service they are going to perceive upon accessing the service.
This feature can be used perform service composition basing on dynamic, end-to-end quality of service spec-i cations that depend on the overall path followed by service information.
In this paper we have presented a quality model for multichannel information systems.
In this context, and in particular if we follow an adaptive perspective as the one adopted in the MAIS project, service provisioning and its associated quality values cannot be automatically determined.
In fact, channels and user requirements can change during or before service provisioning, and on the other hand the service provider can dynamically improve the provisioning quality if necessary.
To enable such an adaptation, the model takes into account the different objects which compose a multichannel information system, i.e., service, network, device, and user.
Each of these objects is modeled with respect to the related community which de nes the quality parameters and their admissible ranges.
Referring to the community, in fact, we are able to normalize the description of the objects in order to simplify the comparison among them.
The proposed model is therefore a general framework which is useful for both the contract speci cation and contract enactment.
In the  rst case the quality parameters can be used to specify multiparty contracts between all involved partners, de ning admissible values for each involved object.
Once the contract is de ned, the quality parameters are also used to monitor potential problems and to adapt service provisioning both on provider side and on channel side to context characteristics changed during the enactment.
