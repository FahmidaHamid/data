Knowledge collaboration includes contributing to, authoring within, discussing, sharing, exploring, and deploying a collective knowledge base [12].
The World Wide Web opens up new possibilities for people to share knowledge, exchange information, and conduct knowledge collaboration.
Numerous kinds of knowledge collaborative online communities sprang up the world.
BBS, Weblog and Wiki have become well-known words in our daily life.
On the other hand, computers have no understanding of the content and meaning of Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Com  mittee (IW3C2).

the submitted information data.
Assessing and classifying the information data have mainly relied on the manual work of a few experienced people (the editors or moderators) in these knowledge collaboration systems.
With growth of a community, the workload of the manual work will become heavier and heavier.
Especially in online BBS forum communities, the more people join the discussion, the heavier workload the forum moderators have to bear.
Document clustering and classi cation have long been studied as a post-retrieval document visualization technique [16,
 uments together based on their similarities; the documents that are relevant to a certain topic will hopefully be allocated in a single cluster [27].
The objective of our work is to develop a document clustering algorithm to categorize the Web documents in an online community.
Such a clustering result is absolutely helpful in speeding up the knowledge collaboration in the online community.
For experienced members and editors, an automatic Web document clustering will help them to identify and assess high qualify documents more easily and e ciently.
For newbies and guests, an e -cient online searching service as well as a categorical index of the whole forum will help them to look for their interested topics.
Any clustering technique replies on four concepts: data representation model, similarity measure, clustering model and clustering algorithm that generates the clusters using the data model and the similarity measure [7].
The Vector Space Document (VSD) model [19] is a very widely used data representation model for document classi cation and clustering today.
The common framework of this data model starts with a representation of any document as a feature vector of the words that appear in documents of the data set.
The term-weights (usually term-frequencies) of the words are also contained in each feature vector [22].
The similarity between two documents is computed with one of several similarity measures based on two corresponding feature vectors, e.g.
cosine measure, Jaccard measure, and Euclidean distance measure.
Su x tree document model and Su x Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm were proposed by Zamir and Etzioni and used in their meta-search engine [26].
STC is a linear time clustering algorithm (linear in the size of the document set), which is based on identifying phrases that are common to groups of documents.
A phrase is an ordered sequence of one or more words [27].
There are two distinct characteristics attracting us to study su x tree document model and posed a new (cid:176)exible n-grams approach to identify all overlap nodes (phrases) among the documents as Longest Common Pre xes (LCPs) [11].
Secondly, one or several phrases are naturally selected to generate a topic summary to label the corresponding cluster during building the clusters.
After implementing STC algorithm by following the description of Zamir s papers, we found that STC in point of fact can still obtain quite good results in clustering standard documents as well as document snippets.
However, STC algorithm sometimes generates some large-sized clusters with poor quality in our experiment results of clustering standard documents.
They desperately lower the overall e ectiveness of STC algorithm.
Through analyzing the original design of STC algorithm, we identi ed the reason for dissipating the e ort of STC algorithm as that: there is no e ective quality measure to evaluate the quality of clusters in STC, neither the base clusters designated by the overlap nodes (phrases) in a su x tree nor the clusters generated by the cluster merging.
Furthermore, the weight of each overlap phrase is individually calculated from its length (the number of words in it) and document frequency df, the number of documents containing it (see Section 3.1 or paper [26] for details).
In summary, STC algorithm lacks an e cient similarity measure to assess the importance of each phrase in a global view of entire document set.
On the other hand, VSD model uses a feature vector to represent a document.
The statistical features of all words are taken into account of the word term weights (usually tf-idf ) and similarity measures.
However, in contrast to su x tree document model, the sequence order of words is seldom considered in the clustering algorithms based on this model.
In fact, two document models are isolated in current information retrieval techniques [20].
Therefore we focused our work on how to combine the advantages of two document models in document clustering.
By mapping each node of a su x tree (excludes the root node) into a unique dimension of a M dimensional space (M is the total number of nodes in the su x tree except the root node), each document is represented by a feature vector of M nodes.
Then we rationally apply traditional term weighting schemes to the nodes (phrases) in su x tree document model.
Consequently we  nd out a simple solution to successfully connect two document data models:  rstly the weight (term frequency tf and document frequency df ) of each node are recorded in building the su x tree from the documents, and then cosine similarity measure is used to compute the pairwise similarity of any two documents.
With combination of the word s sequence order consideration of su x tree model and the term weighting scheme of VSD model, the new su x tree similarity measure works pretty good in GAHC algorithm.
Our experimental results show that, new su x tree document clustering (NSTC) algorithm is very e ective in clustering standard documents of the data sets generated from OHSUMED [24] and RCV1 [4] corpus.
Apart from Section 1, this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work.
Section 3 starts with a brief review of su x tree model and STC algorithm, and then the detailed design of the new su x tree similarity measure.
A topic oriented Web document clustering approach follows in Section 4.
Section 5 illustrates some experimental results for testing the e ectiveness and e ciency of the new similarity measure in GAHC algorithm with comparisons of traditional word term weight similarity measure and original STC algorithm.
Finally Section 6 summarizes our work with some considerations on future directions.
Text document clustering has been traditionally investigated as a means of improving the performance of search engines by pre-clustering the entire corpus [22], and a post-retrieval document browsing technique as well [16, 3, 26].
The methods used for document clustering covers several research areas, such as database, information retrieval, and arti cial intelligent including machine learning and natural language processing.
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm might be most commonly used algorithm among the numerous document clustering algorithms.
There are several variants from this algorithm, e.g.
single-link, group-average and complete-link.
In practice, AHC algorithm can often generate a high quality clustering result with a tradeo  of a higher computing complexity [23].
In traditional document models such as VSD model, words or characters are considered to be atomic elements in the statistical feature analysis and extraction.
Clustering methods based on VSD model mostly make use of single word term analysis of document data set.
In order to achieve more accurate document clustering, the importance of developing more informative features has received considerable attention in information retrieval literatures recently.
Bigrams, trigrams and much longer ngrams have been commonly used in statistical natural language processing [2, 9, 25].
Su x tree document model was  rstly proposed in 1997 [13, 26].
Di erent from document models which treat a document as a set of words and ignore the sequence order of the words [1], su x tree document model considers a document to be a set of su x substrings, the common pre xes of the su x substrings are selected as phrases to label the edges of a su x tree.
STC algorithm is developed based on this model and works well in clustering Web document snippets returned from several search engines.
However, the properties of the su x tree model and STC have not been analyzed in their papers [26, 27].
Eissen s paper [20] continued the work and pointed out, STC algorithm is a fusion heuristic that e ciently evaluates the graph-based similarity measure for large document collections.
Furthermore, they also propose several new graph-based similarity measures to compute the document similarities.
Their experimental evaluation results show that the similarity measures, especially the hybrid similarity measure have achieved sig-ni cant performance improvements in MajorClust algorithm and GAHC algorithm.
In this section,  rstly a brief review of su x tree document model and STC algorithm is given, then the de nition new su x tree similarity measure is explained in details.
After that, two important design issues will be discussed, including the time complexity of computing the document similarity based on the su x tree document model.

 and STC Algorithm In text-based information retrieval, a document model is a concept that describes how a set of meaningful features is extracted from a document.
Su x tree document model considers a document d = w1w2:::wm as a string consisting of words wi, not characters (i = 1; 2; :::; m).
A su x tree of document d is a compact trie containing all su xes of document d. Figure 1 is an example of a su x tree composed from three documents1.
The nodes of the su x tree are drawn in circles.
Each internal node has at least two children.
Each edge is labelled with a nonempty substring of a document called a phrase, and its su x node is labelled by the phrase too.
Then each leaf node in the su x tree designates a su x of a document; each internal node represents an overlap phrase shared by at least two su xes.
The more internal nodes shared by two documents, the more similar the documents tend to be.
In Figure 1, each internal nodes is attached with a box respectively (In the practical implementation, each node including leaf node maintains a list storing the numbers displayed in the box.).
The numbers in the box designate the documents which have traversed the corresponding node.
Each upper number designates a document identi er, the number below designates the traversed times of the document.
The original STC algorithm is developed based on the su x tree document model.
In detail, STC algorithm has three logical steps.
Step 1.
The common su x tree generating A su x tree S for all su xes of each document in D = fd1; d2; :::; dN g is constructed.
Each internal node containing at least two di erent documents is selected to be a base cluster, which is composed of the documents designated by the box, and labelled by the phrase of the node.
Step 2.
Base cluster selecting Each base cluster B is assigned a score s(B), s(B) = jBj   f (jP j) (1)
 design of the su x tree similarity measure.
But the numbers in the box of a node designate the node s term frequency and document frequency.
Phrase: cat ate(cid:13) Documents: 1,3(cid:13) Phrase: mouse(cid:13) Documents: 2,3(cid:13) Phrase: cheese(cid:13) Documents: 1,2(cid:13) a(cid:13) b(cid:13) d(cid:13) e(cid:13) c(cid:13) f(cid:13) Phrase: ate(cid:13) Documents: 1,2,3(cid:13) Phrase: too(cid:13) Documents: 2,3(cid:13) Phrase: ate cheese(cid:13) Documents: 1,2(cid:13) Figure 2: The base cluster graph where jBj is the number of documents in B, and jP j is the number of words in P .
Then all base clusters are sorted by the scores, and the top k base clusters are selected for cluster merging in Step 3.
Step 3.
Cluster merging A similarity graph consisting of the k base clusters is generated.
An edge is added to connect two base clusters Bi and Bj if the Jaccord coe cient of Bi and Bj is larger than 0:5, say, when jBi T Bj j jBi S Bj j > 0:5.
The connected components in this graph form the  nal clusters.
For example, the nodes a, b, c, d, e, f are selected to be the base clusters in the su x tree of Figure 1.
Finally the 6 base clusters form a  nal cluster as shown in Figure 2 after cluster merging.
By mapping all nodes n of the common su x tree to a M dimensional space of VSD model (n = 1; 2; :::; M ), each document d can be represented as a feature vector of the weights of M nodes, d = fw(1; d); w(2; d); :::; w(M; d)g (2) Term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf ) is a commonly used information retrieval technique for assigning weights to individual word terms appearing in all documents [22] [18].
When we represent each document as a feature vector in the M dimensional space, it s very easy to understand that the document frequency of each node df (n) is the number of the di erent documents that have traversed node n; the term frequency tf (n; d) of a node n with respect to a document d is the total traversed times of document d through node n. For example in Figure 1, the df of node b is df (b) = 3, the tf of the node with respect to document 1 is tf (b; 1) = 1 (assuming the document identi ers of the three documents to be 1, 2, 3 ).
Therefore we can calculate the weight w(n; d) of node n in document d using the following tf-idf formula: tf idf (n; d) = (1 + log(tf (n; d)))   log(1 +
 df (n) ) (3) After obtaining the term weights of all nodes, it s easy to apply traditional similarity measures like the cosine similarity to compute the similarity of two documents.
In this paper, we use cosine similarity measure to compute the pairwise similarities of all documents.
The GAHC algorithm is used to evaluate the e ectiveness of the new su x tree similarity measure in document clustering.

 Model
 Similarity Measure A su x tree is a data structure that admits e cient string matching and querying.
Su x trees have been studied and used extensively in fundamental string problems such as large volumes of biological sequence data searching [14], approximate string matches [5] and text features extraction in spam email classi cation [17].
In su x tree document model, a document is considered as a string consisting of words, not characters.
During constructing the su x tree, each su x of document B is compared to all su xes which exist in the tree already to  nd out a position for inserting it (as depicted in Figure 3).
The naive, straightforward method to build a su x tree for a document of m words takes O(m2) time.
Ukkonen s paper [21] provided a algorithm to build a su x tree in time linear with the size of a document.
The time complexity of building a su x tree is O(m).
Ukkonen s algorithm is argued for lack of space e -ciency in building a su x tree [6].
However, with the trade o  of space cost, Ukkonen s algorithm makes it possible to build a large incremental su x tree online, which allows us to insert a document into the su x tree and remove it dynamically.
Indeed, su x link data structure allows the searching algorithms to move quickly from one part of the tree to a distant part of the tree in a large su x tree.
In particular, the doubly-linked list data structure (node   edge   suf f ix node) also leaves a large room for us to develop different kind of search strategies in building an online clustering algorithm.
In our current searching algorithm design, a bottom-up search is chosen to extract all internal nodes that traversed by a document.
Assuming that there are N distinct documents in a data set D, the average length of the documents is m (by words).
Then there are a maximum of N   m leaf nodes in the su x tree generated from N documents (each leaf node represents one or more su xes of the documents).
Thus  nding out m leaf nodes representing all su xes of a document requires a full traverse of m   N leaf nodes (the tree data structure directly maintains a list of all leaf nodes), the average time cost is m   N .
Because each node in a su x tree has only one uplink node, the cost for calling back all parent internal nodes of a leave node is trivial in the bottom-up search2.
Consequently the time cost of extracting the all nodes traversed by two documents and computing the cosine similarity is time linear to the size of document set (2   m   N ), regardless of the total number of nodes M in the su x tree.
Finally the total time cost for computing all pairwise similarities for all documents is N   (N   1)   m   N = m   N 3.
In practice, the time cost of manipulating the su x tree to compute the document similarities is very close to the cost of same operation on an inverted index.
Stopword or Stopnode
 Stopwords are frequently occurring, insigni cant words that appear in the documents.
They are useless to index or use in search engines or other search indexes.
Stopwords Lists and stemming algorithms are two commonly used information retrieval techniques for preparing text document.
We also use a standard Stopwords List and Porter stemming algorithm [15] to preprocess the documents to get \clean" documents.
However, we  nd there still exist some commonly occurring words slightly a ecting the precision of the su x tree similarity measures.
Although tf-idf weighting scheme has provided a solution to reduce the negative e ect of these words, almost all popular document clustering algorithms including STC algorithm still prefer to consider these words as new stopwords, and ignore them in their document similarity measure.
For example, STC algorithm maintains a stoplist that is supplemented with Internet speci c words in computing the score of each base cluster, e.g.
\previous", \java", \frames" and \mail".
Words appearing in the stoplist, or that appear in too few or too many documents receives a score of zero in computing the score s(B) of a base cluster.
We clearly understand the positive e ectiveness of the method in VSD model.
The question is, does this idea work in su x tree document model?
Recalling the su x tree sample in Figure 1 and Step 2, 3 of STC algorithm, the base clusters generated by the su x tree are illustrated by Figure 2.
The node b is labelled with a phrase \ate", and the phrase \ate" has a maximum document frequency df = 3 in the graph.
If we consider word \ate" as a stopword, the node b should not be selected to be a base cluster because it gets a zero score.
As a result, other 5 base clusters in the graph will not form a single cluster after the cluster merging.
This problem has not been discussed in original STC algorithm.
Conventional document models, like VSD model ignores the occurring position of words.
Simply ignoring these words in the similarity measure is reasonable.
On the contrary, su x tree document model is trying to keep the sequential order of each word in a document, the same phrase or word might occur in di erent nodes of the su x tree.
Simply ignoring the words (or phrases) becomes impractical in our approach.
In our document similarity measure, the term of a word is replaced by the term of a node in the su x tree.
We proposed a new de nition \stopnode", which applies the same idea of stopwords in the su x tree similarity measure computation.
A node with a high document frequency df can
 decided by the length of its longest common pre x (LCP) in the su x tree.
The maximum length of LCPs in the su x tree of standard documents is only 5 in our experimental data sets.
Thus we say, the time cost is trivial.
phrase and its words might be kept by other nodes in the suf- x tree.
In our practical document clustering algorithm, a threshold idfthd of inverse document frequency (idf ) is given to identify whether a node is a stopnode.
The experiments in Section 5 also provide a su cient proof to this design issue.
As mentioned in Section 1, the objective of our work is to develop a clustering algorithm for analyzing the Web documents in an online forum community.
Almost all Web forum systems use the same client-server system design: a Web server works with its inside programs as a preprocessor to handle HTTP requests and compose Web pages, a database server (usually a SQL server) works as a data storage.
All forum data are processed into formal text content and stored in some tables with well-de ned relationships.
We developed the clustering algorithm with C and PHP languages based on the same platform of a Web based BBS forum system developed by us before [8].
Generally, the Web document clustering algorithm has three logical steps: (1) document preparing, (2) document clustering, and (3) cluster topic summary generating.
Di erent from the Web pages, which are composed by the forum system for people to read in a Web browser (usually Internet Explorer or Firefox ), the content of a topic thread in a forum consists of a topic post and the reply posts.
Each post is saved as a tuple in the corresponding table.
Besides the text of the post, a tuple also has several  elds storing some relevant information of the post, such as the subject title, submitted time, author, view clicks (the number of clicks to the post), and recommend clicks (the number of recommending clicks to the post).
As a Web document, the text of a post might contain HTML tags, BBcode, emotion icon tags or other non-word tokens.
There often exist some posts containing only one or several words, that are used to express the author s responsive emotion without any signi cant meaning, e.g.
\thanks", \good post", \well done" and etc.
To prepare a text document with respect to a topic thread, we access the tuples from database table directly and combine all posts of the same thread into a single document.
Before adding a post into the document, a document \clean-ing" procedure is executed for the post:  rst all non-word tokens are stripped o ; second the text is parsed into words; third all stopwords are identi ed and removed; forth Porter stemming algorithm is applied to all words;  nally all stemmed words are incorporated to be a new plain text post.
After the document \cleaning", the posts containing at least 3 distinct words are selected for document merging.
During the document merging, the subject title of the topic post (the  rst post which creates the thread in the forum) is selected as the title of the document, the text of all selected posts are added into the document in the order of their submitted time.
Some  elds of each post such as view clicks and recommend clicks are also aggregated to the sums respectively.
Of course, the constructed document is saved into a table along with the sums for further processing of clustering algorithm.
With the description of Section 3, it s quite simple to explain how the su x tree clustering algorithm works.
Each thread document is fetched from the corresponding table, and inserted into a su x tree.
The tf and df of each node have been calculated during constructing the su x tree, and the corresponding weight (tf-idf ) is obtained as well.
Thus the pairwise similarity of two documents can be computed with cosine similarity measure.
Finally these pairwise similarities are used in GAHC algorithm to build a  nal clustering result.
The topic summary generating characteristic is a very important design issue arousing our study of su x tree document model and STC algorithm.
Unfortunately GAHC algorithm cannot provide this function to the new clustering algorithm.
How to generate a new topic summary becomes another interesting design issue in our approach.
In fact, topic summary generating concerns two important information retrieval work: (1) ranking the documents in a cluster by a quality score, (2) extracting common phrases as the topic summary of the corresponding cluster.
Evaluating quality of cluster and its documents is still a challenging research topic in modern information retrieval.
However, the Web documents of a forum system can provide some additional human assessments for the document quality evaluation.
For instance, there are three statistical scores provided in our forum system, view clicks, reply posts and recommend clicks.
The quality score of a document d can be calculated with the following formula.
q(d) = jdj   v   r   c (5) where jdj is the number of words in the document, v is view clicks, r is reply posts, and c is recommend clicks of the document respectively.
Thus all documents in the same cluster are sorted by their quality scores.
We choose the top 10% documents as the representatives of the cluster (at least 5 documents for each cluster).
Then the nodes traversed by the representative documents are selected and sorted by their idf in ascend order.
Finally the top 5 nodes are selected (excluding stopn-odes).
The original words in their phrases (without stemming) form a topic summary to label the cluster.
In this section, we empirically evaluate the e ectiveness of the new su x tree similarity measure and traditional word term weight (tf-idf ) similarity measure in the same GAHC algorithm.
The original STC algorithm is compared as well.
To achieve a fair comparison, at  rst some standard document collections without any bias must be provided, then some standard clustering quality measures shall be examined.
We choose F-Measure for evaluating and comparing three clustering algorithms.
The F-Measure is commonly used in evaluating the e ectiveness of clustering and classi cation algorithms [22, 10].
It combines the precision and recall ideas from information retrieval: Let C = fC1; C2; :::; Ckg

 l g designate the "correct" class set of D. Then the recall of cluster j with respect to class i, rec(i; j) is de ned as jCj T C   i j.
The precision of cluster j with respect to class i, prec(i; j) is de ned as jCj T C   i j=jCij.
The F-Measure combines both values according to the following formula.
i j=jC  

 Fi;j = 2   prec(i; j)   rec(i; j) prec(i; j) + rec(i; j) (6) Based on this formula, the F-Measure for overall quality of cluster set C is de ned by the following formula.
l
 i=1 jC   i j jDj   max j=1;:::;k fF (i; j)g (7) Since there is no original binary or source code of STC algorithm and its evaluating document collections provided as the reference for our experiments.
We wrote our own code for original STC algorithm following the description in Zamir s paper and PHD thesis, the corresponding document collection of OHSUMED [24] is also generated by ourselves as well.
The OHSUMED medical abstracts corpus was created to assist information retrieval research [24].
It is a clinically oriented MEDLINE subset consisting of 348,566 references (out of a total of over 7 million), and covers all references from
 document has at least one primary and one secondary Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) indexing terms, discriminating between the focused topics and the brie(cid:176)y mentioned topics.
We also use a subset of OHSUMED corpus, which is very similar to the one used in paper [26].
However, all documents of the corpus are used to create the document collection.
Because the earliest version of Mesh index that we can obtain is 2004, it contains a full version of Mesh index (only the documents in 90-91 are used in the experiments of paper [26]).
We only select the documents having at least one MeSH index term in the \C14-Cardiovascular Diseases (C14)" subbranch of MeSH hierarchy.
The corpus provides us a total of 293,856 documents.
We created a set of disjoint groups of OHSUMED documents, each relating to a speci c topic.
These groups of documents are created as follows.
There are 494 index terms under the \C14" term in the MeSH hierarchy.
For each term we collected its document group: each selected OHSUMED document contains this term as a primary index term, but does not contain any index term that has been selected before.
We discarded document groups with less than 100 documents, and also discarded document groups whose term was an ancestor (in the MeSH hierarchy) of another selected term.
In the end, we created 8 groups of document sets, each group with 100 documents.
The MeSH index terms are: MSH1058, MSH1262, MSH1473, MSH1486, MSH1713, MSH2025, MSH2030 and MSH2235 as identi ed by a TREC-9 MeSH topics  le, named \query.mesh.1-4904".
The document collection that we created has a total of 800 documents, containing 6,281 distinct words after document preprocessing.
The average length of the documents is about 110 (by words).
We also generated a document collection of RCV1 corpus [4].
RCV1 is a corpus that was published by Reuters Corporation for research purposes.
It contains 806,792 documents, each consisting of hundreds up to thousands words.
The documents have been manually enriched by meta information like category (also called topic), geographic region, or industry sector.
RCV1 has 103 di erent categories, arranged within a hierarchy of four top level categories.
Our OHSUMED document collection has 8 disjoint groups of documents already.
It is not necessary to build a new document collection under such a strict condition again.
The purpose of the new RCV1 document collection is that, we want to test the e ectiveness of three clustering algorithms in a more complicated situation near to practice.
We manually identify 10 irrelevant categories according to our knowledge.
The category index terms are: C11, C12, C21, C41, E11, GREL, GSCI, GSPO, GWEA, and M11.
We build a group of documents with regard to each category of C11, C12, C21, C41, E11, M11 :  rstly all documents using the index term as their  rst class term are selected, then 200 documents are randomly chosen from them to form the document group.
For documents of categories GREL, GSCI, GSPO, GWEA, because the documents share a same  rst class term GCAT, we randomly select 200 documents from all documents whose second class term are the corresponding term for each category.
Finally the document collection has 10 groups of documents, containing 19,229 distinct words.
The average length of documents is about 150.
We constructed 3 document sets from OHSUMED and RCV1 document collections respectively.
The overview of the 6 document sets is illustrated in Table 1, where #nodes designates the total number of nodes in the su x tree generated by the data set, and #overlap nodes designates the number of overlap nodes shared by at least two di erent documents.
The original STC algorithm selects the 500 highest scoring base clusters for further cluster merging, but only the top 10 clusters are selected from the merged clusters as the  nal clustering result.
Thus we also allowed GAHC algorithm to generate 10 clusters in the our experiments to conduct as fair as possible comparisons.
We still recorded the total number of clusters generated by the cluster merging in STC, and also computed the F-measure score for each clustering result respectively.
Table 2 lists the F-measure scores computed from the clustering results of three clustering algorithms on 6 document sets, where NSTC designates the results of the new su x tree similarity measure; TDC designates the results of traditional word tf-idf cosine similarity measure; STC designates the results of all clusters generated by STC algorithm, and STC-10 designates the results of the top 10 clusters generated by original STC algorithm; #clusters designates the amount of clusters generated by STC algorithm for each document set.
Comparing with the results of STC-10, NSTC algorithm has a performance improvement of 80% on the average F-measure scores of 6 document sets.
Comparing with results (TDC) of traditional word tf-idf cosine similarity measure with the same GAHC algorithm, NSTC algorithm also achieved an improvement of 51% on the average F-measure scores.

The experimental results indicate the major reason decreasing the e ort of STC algorithm - there is no e ective measure to evaluate the quality of the clusters during the cluster merging (single-link ), eventually the quality of merged clusters cannot be assessed.
Thus STC algorithm seldom generated large size clusters with high quality in the experiments.
In contrast, NSTC can achieve signi cant performance improvements with the e cient evaluation measure provided by GAHC algorithm.
Figure 4 shows the e ect of threshold idfthd for ignoring the stopnodes in NSTC algorithm, the results are obtained from DS3 document set, which contains all documents of OHSUMED document collection.
The F-measure score reaches the top score of 0:801 while idfthd is set to be
 DS6 document set contains all documents of 10 groups in RCV1 document collection.
We use class1-10 to represent the 10 groups respectively.
Figure 5, 6, and 7 respectively illustrate the Precision, Recall, F-measure scores of each cluster in the clustering result of DS6 (there are only
 the 5th cluster is composed of the documents of 3 classes, namely class1, class2, class4 (C11, C12, C41 ).
The cluster shows that some intersections possibly appear among the documents of the 3 classes.
In fact, the method that we used to build RCV1 document collection just ensures the  rst or second class term of the documents to be disjoint.
It is possible that the documents in di erent classes share a same second or third class term of the corpus category index.
The average F-measure scores that we obtained in DS4, DS5, DS6 is 0:783, which is very close to the average F-measure scores of 0:78 achieved by paper [20].
However, unlike the hybrid measure that they proposed combining single word tf-idf similarity measure and graph-based similarity measure, the complexity of our su x tree similarity measure is simpler and more feasible in practice.

The post data in the experiment are from Apple discussion community (dis-cussions.apple.com).
It s a commercial technical support forum for the products of Apple Company.
We choose 500 threads in the forum \ iPOD with color display - Connecting to Windows" for this experiment.
(We wrote a Web crawler to automatically download the Web pages of the online forum community in Nov. 2005, all these Web pages were parsed into posts and stored in several tables for our research [8].)
Both traditional vector space model and su x tree model play important roles in text-based information retrieval.
However, the two models are used in two isolated ways: almost all clustering algorithms based on VSD model ignore the occurring position of words in the document, the di er-ent semantic meanings of a word in di erent sentences are unavoidably discarded.
Su x tree document model keeps all sequential characteristics of the sentences for each document, phrases consisting of one or more words are used to designate the similarity of two documents.
But the original STC algorithm cannot provide an e ective evaluation method to assess the quality of clusters.

By completely mapping all nodes in the common su x tree into a M dimensional space of VSD model, the advantages of two document models are smoothly inherited in the new document similarity measure.
The signi cant improvement of the clustering performance in our experiments clearly indicates that word order preservation is critical to document clustering and categorization.
We believe that the new similarity measure is suitable to not only hierarchical clustering algorithm but also most traditional clustering algorithms based on VSD model, e.g.
K-means, single-pass.
More performance evaluation comparisons for these clustering algorithms with the new su x tree similarity measure have been in the consideration of our further work.
The concept of the su x tree similarity measure is very simple, but the implementation is quite di cult.
Our work presented in this paper is mainly focused on improving the e ectiveness of document clustering algorithms.
E ciency optimization of the algorithm has been a target of our current work, both the time e ciency and the space e ciency.
We can also foresee the potential power of the su x tree similarity measure in processing documents of other ethnological languages.
Applying the new similarity measure in Chinese document clustering is also a part of our future work.
