It is common that the current keyword-based search misses highly relevant pages and returns a lot of irrelevant pages for user requests, since the keyword-based search is ignorant of the type of resources a user wants to get and the semantic relationships between the resources and keywords.
In order to effectively retrieve the most relevant top-k resources in searching in the Semantic Web, [3, 5] propose ranking models using the ontology which presents the meaning of resources and the relationships among the resources.
These works determine the relevance based on the link analysis where the amount of relationships and the speci city of the relationships are considered, but it is insuf cient for precise ranking.
The ranking model in [5] does not consider the diversity of semantic relationships.
The work in [3] depends on domain experts to determine the weights of all relationships in the instance level.
Also, the query consisting of multiple keywords with different importance is not effectively handled.
In this paper, we propose an effective semantic search technique considering the diversity of semantic relationships.
We propose a measure for weighting a semantic relationship.
Based on this, we suggest a novel ranking model.
In this section, we present some de nitions for our work.
De nition 1.
(Schema) Schema S is de ned as <C, D, P>.
C is the set of classes, D is the set of data types, and P is the set Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
Figure 1: An example of ontology of properties.
For d   C, r   C   D, there can be a property p(d, r)   P .
For each property p(d, r)   P , d is the domain and r is the range of p. p 1(r, d) is the inverse property of p(d, r).
De nition 2.
(Instance Graph) An instance con ned to a schema S = <C, D, P> is de ned as a directed graph G = <V, E>.
V is the set of resources.
[c] indicates the set of instances of c   C   D.
For each v   V, v   [c] if v.type = c. E is the set of property instances.
[p(d, r)] denotes the set of instances of p(d, r)   P .
For each e(vi, vj)   E, e(vi, vj)   [p(d, r)] if e = p, vi   [d] and vj   [r].
vi is the subject and vj is the object of e.
De nition 3.
(Semantic Path) A semantic path sp is a sequence of properties p1(d1,r1) ... pm(dm, rm) in a schema S = <C, D, P> where pi(di, ri)   P and ri and di+1 are the same class or have the same ancestor class (excluding the root) in the class hierarchy.
An instance graph G con ned to schema S can include matches of a semantic path in S. A match of the semantic path is a sequence of instances of properties, which is called semantic path instance.
For example, in Figure 1, writtenBy 1(Professor, Publication) hasTitle(Publication, String) is a semantic path, and writtenBy 1 (prof1, pub1) hasTitle(pub1, top-k...Web ) is a semantic path instance of the semantic path.
De nition 4.
(Semantic Search) Given an instance graph G, the semantic search is to  nd an answer A for query Q = <T, K>.
For each resource a   A, there should be at least one semantic path instance from resource a to data value s in G where a   [T ] and value s contains k   K. IP (a, k) denotes the set of such semantic path instances from a to s including keyword k.
A semantic path consists of one or more properties.
Therefore, in order to measure the weight of a semantic path, we should be able to determine the weight of each property in the semantic path.
The weight of a property is determined according to (1) the amount of information contained in the property, and (2) the characterizability between domain and range of the property.
In the information theory, the information content of an event x can be quanti ed by the occurrence probability of x.
As x occurs rarely, x has more information.
Based on this, the amount of information contained in a property p(d, r) is computed by I(p(d, r)) =   log2 pr(p(d, r)) (1) where pr(p(d, r)) is the probability that a resource is a subject of the property p(d, r) in an instance graph.

To measure the characterizability between the domain and the range, we adapt the mutual information.
The mutual information between the domain d and the range r for a property p(d, r) is computed by (cid:88) (cid:88) o r s d M I(p(d, r)) = pr(s, o)   log2( pr(s, o) pr(s)pr(o) ) (2) where the sample space is [p(d, r)], pr(s) is the probability that e   [p(d, r)] has s as its subject and pr(o) is the probability that e   [p(d, r)] has o as its object.
Also, pr(s, o) is the probability that e   [p(d, r)] has s and o as its subject and object at the same time.
By using Equation (1) and (2), we can compute the weight of a property p(d, r) as follows: w(p(d, r)) =     I(p(d, r)) +     M I(p(d, r)) (3) where 0 <  ,   < 1 and I and MI are normalized to be in the same range [0, 1].
As the length of a semantic path gets longer, the relevance between the source and the destination decreases.
Thus, considering the loss of the relevance due to the growing of the length of a semantic path, the weight of the semantic path sp is computed as follows: (cid:161) (cid:89) (cid:162)    length(sp) 1 w(p(d, r)) W (sp) = (4) p(d,r) sp where length(sp) indicates the number of properties in sp, and   is an attenuation parameter which is tunable from 0 to 1.
three relevance criteria are considered.
(cid:80) ip IP (a,ki) W (ip).
In the novel ranking model proposed in this paper, the following   The number of meaningful semantic path instances: We regard resources which have many meaningful semantic path instances directed to keywords as more relevant resources.
The meaningfulness of the semantic path instance is represented by the weight of the semantic path obtained by Equation (4).
The relevance of a resource a for a keyword ki is computed by R(a, ki) =   The coverage of keywords: A user prefers results covering all keywords.
To re ect this preference, we apply the extended boolean model [4] to our ranking model.
A resource is mapped to a point in an n-dimensional space [0, 1]n where n is the number of keywords.
Each dimension represents the relevance of a resource to the corresponding keyword.
The relevance of a resource a is in inverse proportion to the distance from the ideal position [1, ..., 1] to the point of a.
  The distinguishability of keyword: A resource having semantic paths to distinguishable keywords is more relevant than a resource having semantic paths to undistinguishable keywords.
The distinguishability of keyword ki, D(ki), is the inverse of the ratio of data values containing ki to entire data values in the instance graph.
Based on the above mentioned three factors, the relevance score of resource a for keywords K is computed by Rank(a, K) = 1   [ (cid:80)

 p ] (5) (cid:80)
 First, N R(a, ki) is the normalized R(a, ki) in the range [0, 1], which re ects the the number of meaningful semantic path instances.
Second, the Lp-norm distance form of the above model re ects the coverage of keywords, and p (  1) controls the strength of AND-semantics among keywords.
Finally, the distinguishability of keyword, D(ki), is utilized as the weight of a keyword re ecting the importance of the keyword in the model.
Figure 2: The accuracy for top-k results (k = 10 and 20)

 Our semantic search for query < T, K > is performed according to the following four procedures: 1) Extract the set of semantic paths SP from T to K in a schema.
2) Find the set of resources R each of which reaches some keywords in K through SP in an instance graph.
3) For each resource ri   R, compute Rank(ri, K).
In the experiments, we evaluate the accuracy of our ranking model, Semantic Search Rank (SSR ), in comparison with existing methods RQR [5] and HAS [3].
We use two kinds of ontologies from two real datasets: DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/) and IMDB (http://www.im-db.com/interface).
Figure 2 shows the accuracy of three ranking models for  ve representative top-k queries over each ontology.
We use F-measure (= 2 precision recall precision+recall ) [2] to measure the accuracy.
Also, it includes the average of the accuracy for 20 queries over DBLP ontology (i.e,.
AVG20) and 15 queries over IMDB ontology (i.e., AVG15).
The tunable parameters of SSR in our experiments are set as follows:   = 0.2 and   = 0.8 in Equation (3),   = 0.6 in Equation (4), and p = 3 in Equation (5).
As we can observe from the experimental results, SSR outperforms the existing ranking models in general.
In this paper, for an effective semantic search, we proposed a new ranking model considering the diversity of semantic relationships and the coverage of keywords with various importance to determine the relevance.
The experimental results showed that the accuracy of our new ranking model was better than those of other raking models using the ontology.
