As most news pages today are generated from some underlying structured sources, it is intuitive to assume the existence of templates in news pages from a specific news portal.
Some previous template-dependent approaches like Tree Edit Distance (TED) exploit structure similarities of Web pages [1].
However, the generated wrappers only work properly for news pages belonging to previously seen templates.
Any subtle changes in the underlying templates are likely to invalidate the wrappers.
To eliminate the template dependency of wrappers, Zheng et al.
proposed a news extraction technique by exploiting the visual features of news pages [2].
The news title and body in a news page are identified as many visual blocks and extracted accordingly.
However, it may fail to maintain the integrity of an extracted news article as it does not treat a news article as an inseparable unit.
This approach is likely to leave out the news title or fragments of the news body.
Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
However, human beings can always accurately identify the news article from a news page.
This is because the news pages are usually designed to adapt to people s reading habits.
Moreover, the fact that human can easily differentiate news title from news body [2] suggests that news titles and news bodies come with different features.
Note that, there is also correlation between the news title and news body in a news page.
For example, the news title and news body are usually very close in terms of vertical distance, and usually overlap largely in horizontal direction.
If these features of news pages can be fully exploited, it is possible to learn a template-independent wrapper using only news pages from a single news portal such that it can accurately extract news articles from various news portals.
We develop a template-independent wrapper that is able to accurately extract news articles from various news portals on the Web.
Once the wrapper is learned using only a very small number of pages from a single news site, we are able to extract news articles from news pages in various sites.
Let P denote a news page, TDOM denote the DOM tree built from P and T denote a subtree of TDOM.
Definition 1.
T is TTITLE iff the news title is contained in T and not contained in any child subtree of T.
Definition 2.
T is the TBODY iff the whole news body is contained in T and not contained in any child subtree of T.
Then the news extraction problem is defined as follows: given any P, identify TTITLE and TBODY from TDOM, respectively.
Using novel features defined in following sections, we built TTITLE and TBODY identification model based on nonlinear SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel respectively.
Texts in news pages are usually carefully arranged in a comfortable format for reading via using formatting elements, which are the kind of HTML elements mainly used for texts formatting, including paragraph (<p>), bold font (<b>), new line (<br>), italic font (<i>) and highlight (<strong>).
Let R denote the root element of T, and FE denote the collection of formatting elements which are present in the child elements of R. Let FEA denote all formatting elements inside the first two screens.
The bounding rectangle of T denoted by Rect can be obtained.
Features of T include the following six: { RectLeft, RectTop, RectWidth, RectHeight, FormattingElementsNum, FormatedContentLen} of Rect.
RectWidth, RectHeight are the width and height of Rect.
is normalized by total FormattingElementNum of FEA.
3) FormatedContentLen is the total length of texts contained in FE.
It is normalized by total FormatedContentLen of FEA.
Here features of T include the following ten: { RectLeft, RectTop, RectWidth, RectHeight,Overlap, Dist, Flat, FontSize, EndWithFullStop, WordNum }
 News title and body are usually close in horizontal direction.
2) Dist describes the vertical distance between T and TBODY.
The news title is not likely to be far away from the news body in terms of vertical distance.
3) Flat describes the shape of T. Let min be the shorter edge of the bounding rectangle of T, and max be the longer one.
Flat is defined to be the ratio min/max.
This is based on the observation that news titles are always bounded by long narrow rectangles.
4) FontSize is the font size of the root element of T. It is based on the observation that news titles are always displayed in font sizes larger enough to be distinguished from news bodies.
5) EndWithFullStop describes whether the text contained in T ends up with a full stop.
By convention, a title hardly ends up with a full stop.
This helps distinguish news titles from sentences.
6) WordNum describes the number of words in the text contained in T. This feature exploits the fact that news titles would not contain paragraphs of texts.
We use a dataset of 4,073 news pages crawled from 12 online news sites.
among which 10, 20, 40 training examples are randomly chosen to train 3 wrappers (W10, W20, W40) respectively.
And in each site, we randomly choose 40 pages for testing.
The 480 (40 pages 12 sites) testing pages are different from training pages.
Then each of the 36 learned wrappers is applied to extract news articles from the 480 testing pages.
Finally, 17,280 (36 wrappers 480 testing pages) extracted news articles are evaluated by user study.
Table 1 shows the testing results.
We can see that all these 36 wrappers trained from a small number of pages achieved accuracy higher than 96%, which demonstrates the stability of our approach.
Also, our approach only requires a very small number of training examples to achieve this performance.
All the three wrappers trained from USNEWS achieved the highest accuracy, which implies that USNEWS is a good training site.
our template-independent wrapper over thousands of pages.
The USNEWS-W40 wrapper trained in first experiment is used in this experiment.
40 pages from USNEWS are randomly chosen out for training the USNEWS-W40 wrapper and all the remaining 3,973 pages are used for testing.
The 3,973 extracted news articles are evaluated by user study.
Table 2 shows the testing results.
The wrapper achieved 98.1% accuracy.
This demonstrates that our proposed approach can deal with a large variety of news pages.
The state-of-the-art method proposed by Reis [1] is based on template-level wrapper induction.
It is unable to extract the news articles from any Web news site.
Moreover, our approach achieved significantly higher accuracy than Reis  published 87.71% accuracy [1].

 Overall this paper we proposed an effective approach
