We propose to utilize the collaborative knowledge of human beings stored on Wikipedia[1] to generate semantic graphs of suggested search terms.
A semantic graph of a given search term is centered on the term, and there are tons of related search terms that link to each other with various weights on the links.
It is similar to an egocentric social network but uses terms to replace people in nodes.
We propose to use an important hidden network, which links Wikipedia s contributors (i.e., article editors) to key terms on Wikipedia pages, to consider the relatedness of terms as well as how close the terms are.
In our work, the calculation of the relatedness of two terms does not base on whether the terms are Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
hyperlinked through the  related links  in a Wikipedia page, because this approach cannot weight the semantic proximity of terms.
Our hypothesis is that when a single editor contributes to two articles in which the two terms occurred separately, there is certain likelihood that these two terms are somehow related based on high clustering coefficients of social networks.
We thus draw a complex semantic graph between contributors and terms and conduct to one-dimensional graphs with weighted links.
We propose a Collective Intelligent based Term Suggestion (CITS) system, which provides novel semantic related term suggestions as semantic graphs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we present our framework of semantic graph based term suggestion functions.
User evaluation results of the proposed system are reported in Section 3.
Finally, conclusions and future work directions are provided in Section 4.
Each Wikipedia document contains related terms which form a kind of conceptual network.
For each article, all versions and corresponding contributors are stored.
Social networks of contributors and their edited articles can then be formed.
These two networks provide basic elements for computing semantic relatedness.
We crawled thousands of Wikipedia articles to obtain hyperlinks and contributors  information from editorial histories for constructing the relationships between terms.
Beginning from each topic page, we crawled all of the topic s internal links to create a concept network.
In addition, for each article a record of all contributors and their editorial histories is maintained in Wikipedia.
We identified the relationships between these articles and their respective contributions as a new type of network, a specific bipartite network.
hyperlinks linked to Wii-related terms, within the articles, focused on different topics such as  Nintendo  and  Xbox 360,  which are Let us consider a topic  Tm = Wii  and its related articles as an example, we treat  Wii  not just as a topic but also as a key term which we denote as T(cid:2923)(cid:2868) .
Beside  Wii , there are many internal denoted asT(cid:2923)H(cid:2919).
So, a set of Wii-related terms can be created and is denoted asT(cid:2923)(cid:3404)(cid:4668)T(cid:2923)(cid:2868),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3117),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3118),(cid:1710),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3172)(cid:4669) .
We editorial history RT(cid:2923)(cid:3404)(cid:4668)RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3116),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3117),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3118),(cid:1710),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3172)(cid:4669) of T(cid:2923) , where RT(cid:2923)H denotes the set of records corresponding toT(cid:2923)H(cid:3167).
On the the relationship network among internal hyperlinks as the concept network.
For each article, we examine the latest 500 revisions of article s basis of this information provided by Wikipedia, we designed a parser to ignore anonymous contributor so we can see all of the real contributors who have contributed to those specific set of topics.
After lists of this procedure, we can create identify contributed to any of the hyperlinked terms in Tm.

The topic-contributor bipartite graph can be represented For a topic-contributor bipartite graph consisting of n topics and m contributors, we can express the editing relationship by a binary We group together all of the terms contributed by a group of contributors as an effective sampling.
Indeed, the number of all of the terms contributed by this group of contributors CTm is definitely larger than the number of specific related terms Tm.
Each contributor may have his diverse interests.
Thus, this grouping procedure reflects the semantic relatedness buried in human behavior.
This step introduces a useful sampling scheme for semantic relatedness and paves a way to locate important information inside the human centric concept and thus extend the relatedness of each term.

We then fold this bipartite graph into a topic number of common members between contributor vectors b(cid:2919), b(cid:2920) W(cid:2919)(cid:2920)(cid:3404)  b(cid:2920)(cid:2921)(cid:3404)b(cid:2920) b(cid:2920)T, (2)  (cid:2921)(cid:2880)(cid:2869) that is, the value of W(cid:2919)(cid:2920) is computed by the inner product of b(cid:2919) and b(cid:2920).
This measurement can be generalized to the whole matrix BTC.
W(cid:2923)(cid:3400)(cid:2924)(cid:3404)BTCBTC(cid:2955) (3) So the weights of the corresponding semantic graph can be expressed by BTC denotes whether the topics have been edited by the only graph, which is called the semantic graph, by identifying the via the following formula (1) b(cid:2919)(cid:2921)(cid:3400) (cid:2868),(cid:2915)(cid:2922)(cid:2929)(cid:2915).

Table 1 shows a comparison example of the related terms constructed from the proposed method and from the WordNet [2].
We can see that the proposed method is arguably closer to most users  perception today.
We take  Number Theory  as a testing example and compare with Google [3].
When keying in  number theory  into CITS, the words like  Chinese remainder theory ,  Fermat s little theory ,  Prime number theory ,  Riemann zeta function , and  Goldbach's conjecture , were listed in the suggestion box.
But, among the suggested words providing by Google, we can only find words  Number theory web  that is conceptually relevant.

The experiment showed that 21% users think CITS is much better, 47% better, 10% the same, 17% worse, and 5% much worse, as compared with Google.
Yahoo!
has provided two kinds of term suggestions.
One of them makes more like a word-completion suggestion and the other, called  Explore concepts , also a conceptual term suggestion mechanism.
User studies on the basis of the same group of participants showed for word-completion approach: 12% users think CITS is much better, 41% better, 15% the same, 27% worse, and 5% much worse, as compared with Yahoo!.
Compare with the Yahoo! s Explore Concepts approach, users studies showed 8% think CITS is much better, 39% better, 35% the same, 15% worse, and 3% much worse.
A demo site is at http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/CITS/.
In this paper, we propose a new framework for performing human-centric searches with complex semantic relatedness.
We see a potential advantage in using such semantic graphs for various search tasks in people s daily search activities.
Compared with WordNet, our approach leverages knowledge bases that are orders of magnitude larger and more comprehensive.
Compared with commercial search engines such as Google and Yahoo!, CITS results in better semantic related search suggestions, and is thus more activated due to its usage of real time Wikipedia-based social network structures.
Our future work will focus on enhancing CITS s search capabilities by adding personalization and trend prediction to the design.
