A tagcloud is a visual presentation of a set of words related to an object(or a collection of objects); a site, a blog entry, a person, etc.
The size of a word is determined by the popularity to the tagged object; representatively the number of tagged time with each tag determines the size.
The larger the tag is, the more the tag has weight on the tagged object.
In spite of their simple form, tagclouds have drawn a lot of attention from research communities [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
How users tag objects was surveyed by James et al.
[8]; they found tagclouds are not enough to help users navigate.
Ri-vadeneira et al. [7] performed evaluation studies on impression formation.
As for goal-orientated tasks, simple alphabetical word lists are preferred over tagclouds [5].
Nielsen [6] pursued the so-called second generation tagclouds, which o er several improvements to overcome tagcloud limitations.
Kaser et al. [4] proposed algorithms to create 2D tagclouds.
A recent interview analysis by Hearst et al.
[3] concluded that the main value of tagclouds is as a signal or maker of individual or social interaction with information.

Considering the role of tagcloud as a social signaller, it is important to attract peoples  attention rapidly.
Our hypothesis is that people pay more attention to the content tagged with emotional tags than reasonable tags at their  rst look.
Thus, we propose here emotional tagclouds, where tag size is determined by its entropy value.
Our method simply picks up popular tags to describe the content as usual but a tag with high entropy is emphasized by enlarged font size.
We evaluated our method by users and found that, at a  rst look, emotional tagclouds gather more attention than ordinary tagclouds.
We consider that the problem is one of more fully utilizing the material posted on the web by providing social signaling tools that more rapidly attract the attention of users.
For this task, our solution is to create more attractive (emotional) tagclouds.
We consider to realize tagcloud in a text layout.
From our preliminary survey, alphabetical ordering is the best ordering for users to understand the tagclouds, which is also con rmed by related work [5].
We crawled a set of folksonomy triples composed of user, tag, and URL collected from delicious.com in a month period and used it as our test data.
The number of users, tags and URLs were 806661, 561952, and 54366, respectively.
From careful observation of tags attached to the URLs in the data set, we noticed two facts.
One, tag popularity is a good criterion with which to pick up tags for content description.
Two, we found there may tags contained words that represented  Identifying Qualities or Characteristics  [2] like cool, fun, weird.
We call these tags as emotional tags in this paper.
Further observation of these emotional tags found that they tend to have higher entropy than other tags [1].
Given these observations, we developed a strategy for creating emotional tagclouds, see Table 1.
Before calculating tag entropy, we apply the semantic smoothing technique proposed by Wu et al. [9], which grasps the semantic relationship among folksonomy triples better than naive sparse vector model [1].
In a preliminary experiment, the entropy of probabilistic distributions o ered higher precision for extracting emotional tags than the entropy yielded by sparse vector model.
Fig. 1 shows examples of tagclouds created by both methods.
The emotional tag cool which has high entropy, is en-topk : top-k popular tags attached to object entropy(t) : entropy value of tag t emax : the maximum entropy of top-k tags.

Our experimental setup is as follows.

In the normal cloud, font size is determined by popularity.
The two tagclouds were shown side-by-side.
Since we assigned tagclouds randomly, left or right, users do not know which was normal and which was our proposal.

who had high interest level to the content, 70% of them selected emotional tagclouds.
On the other hand, normal tagclouds are perceived to better for describing content, especially after understanding the content.
Since eight users participated in the experiment, this result is preliminary.
In this paper, we proposed a novel tagcloud where font size is determined by tag entropy value not tag popularity.
Our initial experiments showed that emotional tagclouds are more attractive at  rst look than normal tagclouds, whose font size is determined by tag popularity.
Other observations from our experiments are listed below.
determining which tag in a tagcloud is largest is important.
that have only one tag is large and all the others are small are perceived to be unattractive and not descriptive.
Emotional tagclouds rarely have this structure since the emotional tags exhibit smooth distributions, i.e. no fat-tailed distributions, unlike the normal tag-clouds.
Some users felt bored with cool since it appears several times in the experiment, and another user felt that the result was a bit like spam.
As future work, we ll conduct a more detailed user evaluation and pursue more attractive tagclouds as social signallers on the web.
