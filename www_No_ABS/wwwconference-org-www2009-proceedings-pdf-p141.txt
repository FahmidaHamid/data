Understanding how people s opinions are received and evaluated is a fundamental problem that arises in many domains, such as in marketing studies of the impact of reviews on product sales, or in political science models of how support for a candidate depends on the views he or she expresses on different topics.

is also increasingly important in the user interaction dynamics of large participatory Web sites.
Here we develop a framework for understanding and modeling how opinions are evaluated within online communities.
The problem is related to the lines of computer-science research on opinion, sentiment, and subjective content [18], but with a crucial twist in its formulation that makes it fundamentally distinct from that body of work.
Rather than asking questions of the form  What did Y think of X? , we are asking,  What did Z think of Y s opinion of X?  Crucially, there are now three entities in the process rather than two.
Such three-level concerns are widespread in everyday life, and integral to any study of opinion dynamics in a community.
For example, political polls will more typically ask,  How do you feel about Barack Obama s position on taxes?  than  How do you feel about taxes?  or  What is Barack Obama s position on taxes?  (though all of these are useful questions in different contexts).
Also, Heider s theory of structural balance in social psychology seeks to understand subjective relationships by considering sets of three entities at a time as the basic unit of analysis.
But there has been relatively little investigation of how these three-way effects shape the dynamics of online interaction, and this is the topic we consider here.
The Helpfulness of Reviews.
The evaluation of opinions takes place at very large scales every day at a number of widely-used Web sites.
Perhaps most prominently it is exempli ed by one of the largest online e-commerce providers, Amazon.com, whose website includes not just product reviews contributed by users, but also evaluations of the helpfulness of these reviews.
(These consist of annotations that say things like,  26 of 32 people found the following review helpful , with the corresponding data-gathering question,  Was this review helpful to you? ) Note that each review on Amazon thus comes with both a star rating   the number of number of stars it assigns to the product   and a helpfulness vote   the information that a out of b people found the review itself helpful.
(See Figure 4 for two examples.)
This distinction re ects precisely the kind of opinion evaluation we are considering: in addition to the question  what do you think of book X? , users are also being asked  what do you think of user Y s review of book X?  A large-scale snapshot of Amazon reviews and helpfulness votes will form the central dataset in our study, as detailed below.
The factors affecting human helpfulness evaluations are not well understood.
There has been a small amount of work on automatic gression problem with Amazon helpfulness votes providing labeled data [10, 15, 17].
Some of this research has indicated that the helpfulness votes of reviews are not necessarily strongly correlated with certain measures of review quality; for example, Liu et al. found that when they provided independent human annotators with Amazon review text and a precise speci cation of helpfulness in terms of the thoroughness of the review, the annotators  evaluations differed signi cantly from the helpfulness votes observed on Amazon.
All of this suggests that there is in fact a subtle relationship between two different meanings of  helpfulness : helpfulness in the narrow sense   does this review help you in making a purchase decision?
  and helpfulness  in the wild,  as de ned by the way in which Amazon users evaluate each others  reviews in practice.
It is a kind of dichotomy familiar from the design of participatory Web sites, in which a presumed design goal   that of highlighting reviews that are helpful in the purchase process   becomes intertwined with complex social feedback mechanisms.
If we want to understand how these de nitions interact with each other, so as to assist users in interpreting helpfulness evaluations, we need to elucidate what these feedback mechanisms are and how they affect the observed outcomes.
The present work: Social mechanisms underlying helpfulness evaluation.
In this paper, we formulate and assess a set of theories that govern the evaluation of opinions, and apply these to a dataset consisting of over four million reviews of roughly 675,000 books on Amazon s U.S. site, as well as smaller but comparably-sized corpora from Amazon s U.K., Germany, and Japan sites.
The resulting analysis provides a way to distinguish among competing hypotheses for the social feedback mechanisms at work in the evaluation of Amazon reviews: we offer evidence against certain of these mechanisms, and show how a simple model can directly account for a relatively complex dependence of helpfulness on review and group characteristics.
We also use a novel experimental methodology that takes advantage of the phenomenon of review  plagiarism  to control for the text content of the reviews, enabling us to focus exclusively on factors outside the text that affect helpfulness evaluation.
In our initial exploration of non-textual factors that are correlated with helpfulness evaluation on Amazon, we found a broad collection of effects at varying levels of strength.1 A signi cant and particularly wide-ranging set of effects is based on the relationship of a review s star rating to the star ratings of other reviews for the same product.
We view these as fundamentally social effects, given that they are based on the relationship of one user s opinion to the opinions expressed by others in the same setting.
2 Research in the social sciences provides a range of well-studied
 authors with addresses in U.S. territories outside the 50 states get consistently lower helpfulness votes.
This is a persistent effect whose possible bases lie outside the scope of the present paper, but it illustrates the ways in which non-textual factors can be correlated with helpfulness evaluations.
Previous work has also noted that longer reviews tend to be viewed as more helpful; ultimately it is a de nitional question whether review length is a textual or non-textual feature of the review.
ternative hypothesis: the people evaluating review helpfulness are considering actual product quality rather than other reviews, but aggregate opinion happens to coincide with objective product quality.
This hypothesis is not consistent with our experimental results.
However, in future work it might be interesting to directly control for product quality.
hypotheses for how social effects in uence a group s reaction to an opinion, and these provide a valuable starting point for our analysis of the Amazon data.
In particular, we consider the following three broad classes of theories, as well as a fourth straw-man hypothesis that must be taken into account.
(i) The conformity hypothesis.
One hypothesis, with roots in the social psychology of conformity [4], holds that a review is evaluated as more helpful when its star rating is closer to the consensus star rating for the product   for example, when the number of stars it assigns is close to the average number of stars over all reviews.
(ii) The individual-bias hypothesis.
Alternately, one could hypothesize that when a user considers a review, he or she will rate it more highly if it expresses an opinion that he or she agrees with.3 Note the contrasts and similarities with the previous hypothesis: rather than evaluating whether a review is close to the mean opinion, a user evaluates whether it is close to their own opinion.
At the same time, one might expect that if a diverse range of individuals apply this rule, then the overall helpfulness evaluation could be hard to distinguish from one based on conformity; this issue turns out to be crucial, and we explore it further below.
(iii) The brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis.
The name of this hypothesis comes from studies performed by Amabile [3] that support the argument that  negative reviewers [are] perceived as more intelligent, competent, and expert than positive reviewers.  One can recognize everyday analogues of this phenomenon; for example, in a research seminar, a dynamic may arise in which the nastiest question is consistently viewed as the most insightful.
(iv) The quality-only straw-man hypothesis.
Finally, there is a challenging methodological complication in all these styles of analysis: without speci c evidence, one cannot dismiss out of hand the possibility that helpfulness is being evaluated purely based on the textual content of the reviews, and that these non-textual factors are simply correlates of textual quality.
In other words, it could be that people who write long reviews, people who assign particular star ratings in particular situations, and people from Massachusetts all simply write reviews that are textually more helpful   and that users performing helpfulness evaluations are simply reacting to the text in ways that are indirectly re ected in these other features.
Ruling out this hypothesis requires some means of controlling for the text of reviews while allowing other features to vary, a problem that we also address below.
We now consider how data on star ratings and helpfulness votes can support or contradict these hypotheses, and what it says about possible underlying social mechanisms.
Deviation from the mean.
A natural  rst measure to investigate is the relationship of a review s star rating to the mean star rating of all reviews for the product; this, for example, is the underpinning of the conformity hypothesis.
With this in mind, let us de ne the helpfulness ratio of a review to be the fraction of evaluators who found it to be helpful (in other words, it is the fraction a/b when a out of b people found the review helpful), and let us de ne the product average for a review of a given product to be the average star
 tions from social psychology; due to the space limitations, we omit a discussion of this here.
the median helpfulness ratio of reviews decreases monotonically as a function the absolute difference between their star rating and the product average.
(The same trend holds for other quantiles.)
In fact the dependence is surprisingly smooth, with even seemingly subtle changes in the differences from the average having noticeable effects.
This  nding on its own is consistent with the conformity hypothesis: reviews in aggregate are deemed more helpful when they are close to the product average.
However, a closer look at the data raises complications, as we now see.
First, to assess the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis, it is natural to look not at the absolute difference between a review s star rating and its product average, but at the signed difference, which is positive or negative depending on whether the star rating is above or below the average.
Here we  nd something a bit surprising (Figure 2).
Not only does the median helpfulness as a function of signed difference fall away on both sides of 0; it does so asymmetrically: slightly negative reviews are punished more strongly, with respect to helpfulness evaluation, than slightly positive reviews.
In addition to being at odds with the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis for Amazon reviews, this observation poses problems for the conformity hypothesis in its pure form.
It is not simply that closeness to the average is rewarded; among reviews that are slightly away from the mean, there is a bias toward overly positive ones.
Variance and individual bias.
One could, of course, amend the conformity hypothesis so that it becomes a  conformity with a tendency toward positivity  hypothesis.
But this would beg the question; it wouldn t suggest any underlying mechanism for where the favorable evaluation of positive reviews is coming from.
Instead, to look for such a mechanism, we consider versions of the individual-bias hypothesis.
Now, recall that it can be dif cult to distinguish conformity effects from individual-bias effects in a domain such as ours: if people s opinions (i.e., star ratings) for a product come from a single-peaked distribution with a maximum near the average, then the composite of their individual biases can produce overall helpfulness votes that look very much like the results of conformity.
We therefore seek out subsets of the products on which the two effects might be distinguishable, and the argument above suggests starting with products that exhibit high levels of individual variation in star ratings.
In particular, we associate with each product the variance of the star ratings assigned to it by all its reviews.
We then group products by variance, and perform the signed-difference analysis above on sets of products having  xed levels of variance.
We  nd (Figure 3) that the effect of signed difference to the average changes smoothly but in a complex fashion as the variance increases.
The role of variance can be summarized as follows.
  When the variance is very low, the reviews with the highest helpfulness ratios are those with the average star rating.
  With moderate values of the variance, the reviews evaluated as most helpful are those that are slightly above the average star rating.
  As the variance becomes large, reviews with star ratings both above and below the average are evaluated as more helpful than those that have the average star rating (with the positive reviews still deemed somewhat more helpful).
These principles suggest some qualitative  rules  for how   all other things being equal   one can seek good helpfulness evaluations in our setting: With low variance go with the average; with moderate variance be slightly above average; and with high variance avoid the average.
This qualitative enumeration of principles initially seems to be fairly elaborate; but as we show in Section 5, all these principles are consistent with a simple model of individual bias in the presence of controversy.
Speci cally, suppose that opinions are drawn from a mixture of two single-peaked distributions   one with larger mixing weight whose mean is above the overall mean of the mixture, and one with smaller mixing weight whose mean is below it.
Now suppose that each user has an opinion from this mixture, corresponding to their own personal score for the product, and they evaluate reviews as helpful if the review s star rating is within some  xed tolerance of their own.
We can show that in this model, as variance increases from 0, the reviews evaluated as most helpful are initially slightly above the overall mean, and eventually a  dip  in helpfulness appears around the mean.
Thus, a simple model can in principle account for the fairly complex series of effects illustrated in Figure 3, and provide a hypothesis for an underlying mechanism.
Moreover, the effects we see are surprisingly robust as we look at different national Amazon sites for the U.K., Germany, and Japan.
Each of these communities has evolved independently, but each exhibits the same set of patterns.
The one nontrivial and systematic deviation from the pattern among these four countries is in the analogue of Figure 3 for Japan: as with the other countries, a  dip  appears at the average in the high-variance case, but in Japan the portion of the curve below the average is higher.
This would be consistent with a version of our two-distribution individual-bias model in which the distribution below the average has higher mixing weight   representing an aspect of the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis in this individual-bias framework, and only for this one national version of the site.
Controlling for text: Taking advantage of  plagiarism .
Finally, we return to one further issue discussed earlier: how can we offer evidence that these non-textual features aren t simply serving as correlates of review-quality features that are intrinsic to the text itself?
In other words, are there experiments that can address the quality-only straw man hypothesis above?
To deal with this, we make use of rampant  plagiarism  and duplication of reviews on Amazon.com (the causes and implications of this phenomenon are beyond the scope of this paper).
This is a fact that has been noted and studied by earlier researchers [7], and for most applications it is viewed as a pathology to be remedied.
But for our purposes, it makes possible a remarkably effective way to control for the effect of review text.
Speci cally, we de ne a  plagiarized  pair of reviews to be two reviews of different products with near-complete textual overlap, and we enumerate the several thousand instances of plagiarized pairs on Amazon.
(We distinguish these from reviews that have been cross-posted by Amazon itself to different versions of the same product.)
Not only are the two members of a  plagiarized  pair associated with different products; very often they also have signi cantly different star ratings and are being used on products with different averages and variances.
(For example, one copy of the review may be used to praise a book about the dangers of global warming while the other copy is used to criticize a book that is favorable toward the oil industry).
We  nd signi cant differences in the helpfulness ratios within plagiarized pairs, and these differences con rm many of the the effects we observe on the full dataset.
Speci cally, within a  plagiarized  pair, the copy of the review that is closer to the average gets the higher helpfulness ratio in aggregate.
Thus the widespread copying of reviews provides us with a way to see that a number of social feedback effects   based on the outcomes even for reviews that are textually close to identical.
Further related work.
We also mention some relevant prior literature that has not already been discussed above.
The role of social and cognitive factors in purchasing decision-making has been extensively studied in psychology and marketing [6, 8, 9, 21], recently making use of brain imaging methodology [16].
Characteristics of the distribution of review star ratings (which differ from helpfulness votes) on Amazon and related sites have been studied previously [5, 13, 23].
Categorizing text by quality has been proposed for a number of applications [1, 12, 14, 19].
Additionally, our notion of variance is potentially related to the idea that people play different roles in online discussion [22].
Our experiments employed a dataset of over 4 million Ama-zon.com book reviews (corresponding to roughly 675,000 books), of which more than 1 million received at least 10 helpfulness votes each.
We made extensive use of the Amazon Associates Webser-vice (AWS) API to collect this data.4 We describe the process in this section, with particular attention to measures we took to avoid sample bias.
We would ideally have liked to work with all book reviews posted to Amazon.
However, one can only access reviews via queries specifying particular books by their Amazon product ID, or ASIN (which is the same as ISBN for most books), and we are not aware of any publicly available list of all Amazon book ASINs.
However, the API allows one to query for books in a speci c category (called a browse-node in AWS parlance and corresponding to a section on the Amazon.com website), and the bestselling titles up to a limit of 4000 in each browse-node can be obtained in this way.
To create our initial list of books, therefore, we performed queries for all 3855 categories three levels deep in the Amazon browse-node hierarchy (actually a directed acyclic graph) rooted at  Books  Subjects .
An example category is Children s Books  Animals  Lions, Tigers & Leopards.
These queries resulted in the initial set of 3,301,940 books, where we count books listed in multiple categories only once.
We then performed a book ltering step to deal with  cross-posting  of reviews across versions.
When Amazon carries different versions of the same item   for example, different editions of the same book, including hardcover and softcover editions and audio-books   the reviews written for all versions are merged and displayed together on each version s product page and likewise returned by the API upon queries for any individual version.5 This means that multiple copies of the same review exist for  mechanical , as opposed to user-driven, reasons.6 To avoid including mechanically-duplicated reviews, we retained only one of the set of alternate versions for each book (the one with the most complete metadata).
The above process gave us a list of 674,018 books for which we retrieved reviews by querying AWS.
Although AWS restricts the number of reviews returned for any given product query to a max-

study.
imum of 100, it turned out that 99.3% of our books had 100 or fewer reviews.
In the case of the remaining 4664 books, we chose to retrieve the 100 earliest reviews for each product to be able to reconstruct the information available to the authors and readers of those reviews to the extent possible.
(Using the earliest reviews ensures the reproducibility of our results, since the 100 earliest reviews comprise a static set, unlike the 100 most helpful or recent reviews.)
As a result, we ended up with 4,043,103 reviews; although some reviews were not retrieved due to the 100-reviews-per-book API cap, the number of missing reviews averages out to roughly just one per ASIN queried.
Finally, we focused on the 1,008,466 reviews that had at least 10 helpfulness votes each.
The size of our dataset compares favorably to that of collections used in other studies looking at helpfulness votes: Liu et al. [17] used about 23,000 digital camera reviews (of which a subset of around 4900 were subsequently given new helpfulness votes and studied more carefully); Zhang and Varadarajan [24] used about
 after  ltering out duplicate reviews and reviews with no more than
 digital-camera reviews after  ltering of duplicate versions and duplicate reviews and reviews with fewer than 5 helpfulness votes; and Ghose and Ipeirotis [11] considered  all reviews since the product was released into the market  (no spec c number is given) for about 400 popular audio and video players, digital cameras, and DVDs.
Several of the hypotheses that we have described concern the relative position of an opinion about an entity vis- -vis the average opinion about that entity.
We now turn, therefore, to the question of how the helpfulness ratio of a review depends on its star rating s deviation from the average star rating for all reviews of the same book.
According to the conformity hypothesis, the helpfulness ratio should be lower for reviews with star ratings either above or below the product average, whereas the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis translates to the  asymmetric  prediction that the helpfulness ratio should be higher for reviews with star ratings below the product average than for overly positive reviews.
(No speci c predictions for helpfulness ratio vis- -vis product average is made by either the individual-bias or quality-only hypothesis without further assumptions about the distribution of individual opinions or text quality.)
De ning the average.
For a given review, let the computed product-average star rating (abbreviation: computed star average) be the average star rating as computed over all reviews of that product in our dataset.
This differs in principle from the Amazon-displayed product-average star rating (abbreviation: displayed star average), the  Average Customer Review  score that Amazon itself displayed for the book at the time we downloaded the data.
One reason for the difference is that Amazon rounds the displayed star average to the nearest half-star (e.g., 3.5 or 4.0)   but for our experiments it is preferable to have a greater degree of resolution.
Another possible source of difference is the very small (0.7%) fraction of books, mentioned in Section 2, for which the entire set of reviews could not be obtained via AWS: the displayed star average would be partially based on reviews that came later than the  rst 100 and which would thus not be in our dataset.
However, the mean absolute difference between the computed star average when rounded to the nearest half-star (0.5 increment) and the displayed star average is only 0.02.
a review s deviation from the computed star average; this behavior is predicted by the conformity hypothesis but not ruled out by the other hypotheses.
The line segments within the bars (connected by the descending line) indicate the median helpfulness ratio; the bars depict the helpfulness ratio s second and third quantiles.
Throughout, grey bars indicate that the amount of data at that x value represents .1% or less of the data depicted in the plot.
Note that both scores can differ from the  Average Customer Review  score that Amazon displayed at the time a helpfulness evalu-ator provided their helpfulness vote, since this time might predate some of the reviews for the book that are in our dataset (and hence that Amazon based its displayed star average on).
In the absence of timestamps on helpfulness votes, this is not a factor that can be controlled for.
Deviation experiments.
We  rst check the prediction of the conformity hypothesis that the helpfulness ratio of a review will vary inversely with the absolute value of the difference between the review s star rating and the computed product-average star rating  we call this difference the review s deviation.
Figure 1 indeed shows a very strong inverse correlation between the median helpfulness ratio and the absolute deviation, as predicted by the conformity hypothesis.
However, this data does not completely disprove the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis, since for a given absolute deviation |x| > 0, it could conceivably happen that reviews with positive deviations |x| (i.e. more favorable than average) could have much worse helpfulness ratios than reviews with negative deviation  |x|, thus dragging down the median helpfulness ratio.
Rather, to directly assess the brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis, we must consider signed deviation, not just absolute deviation.
Surprisingly, the effect of signed deviation on median helpfulness ratio, depicted in the  Christmas-tree  plot of Figure 2, turns out to be different from what either hypothesis would predict.
The brilliant-but-cruel hypothesis clearly does not hold for our data: among reviews with the same absolute deviation |x| > 0, the relatively positive ones (signed deviation |x|) generally have a higher median helpfulness ratio than the relatively negative ones (signed deviation of  |x|), as depicted by the positive slope of the green dotted lines connecting ( |x|,|x|) pairs of datapoints.
But Figure 2 also presents counter-evidence for the conformity Figure 2: The dependence of helpfulness ratio on a review s signed deviation from average is inconsistent with both the brilliant-but-cruel and, because of the asymmetry, the conformity hypothesis.
hypothesis, since that hypothesis incorrectly predicts that the connecting lines would be horizontal.
To account for Figure 2, one could simply impose upon the conformity hypothesis an extra  tendency towards positivity  factor, but this would be quite unsatisfactory: it wouldn t suggest any underlying mechanism for this factor.
So, we turn to the individual-bias hypothesis instead.
In order to distinguish between conformity effects and individual-bias effects, we need to examine cases in which individual people s opinions do not come from exactly the same (single-peaked, say) distribution; for otherwise, the composite of their individual biases could produce helpfulness ratios that look very much like the results of conformity.
One natural place to begin to seek settings in which individual bias and conformity are distinguishable, in the sense just described, is in cases in which there is at least high variance in the star ratings.
Accordingly, Figure 3 separates products by the variance of the star ratings in the reviews for that product in our dataset.
One can immediately observe some striking effects of variance.
First, we see that as variance increases, the  camel plots  of Figure
 vious  gures it was the reviews with a signed deviation of exactly zero that had the highest helpfulness ratios, here we see that once the variance among reviews for a product is 3.0 or greater, the highest helpfulness ratios are clearly achieved for products with signed deviations close to but still noticeably above zero.
(The bene cial effects of having a star rating slightly above the mean are already discernible, if small, at variance 1.0 or so.)
Clearly, these results indicate that variance is a key factor that any hypothesis needs to incorporate.
In Section 5, we develop a simple individual-bias model that does so; but  rst, there is one last hypothesis that we need to consider.
are more agreeable than one-humped Dromedaries.
two-humped and the helpfulness ratio at signed deviation 0 (indicated in red) no longer represents the unique global maximum.
There are nonzero signed deviations in the plot for variance 0 because we rounded variance values to the nearest .5 increment.
As we have noted, our analyses do not explicitly take into account the actual text of reviews.
It is not impossible, therefore, that review text quality may be a confounding factor and that our straw-man quality-only hypothesis might hold.
Speci cally, we have shown that helpfulness ratios appear to be dependent on two key non-textual aspects of reviews, namely, on deviation from the computed star average and on star rating variance within reviews for a given product; but we have not shown that our results are not simply explained by review quality.
Initially, it might seem that the only way to control for text quality is to read a sample of reviews and determine whether the Amazon helpfulness ratios assigned to these reviews are accurate.
Unfortunately, it would require a great deal of time and human effort to gather a suf ciently large set of reevaluated reviews, and human reevaluations can be subjective; so it would be preferable to  nd a more ef cient and objective procedure.

 camera reviews,  nding that the original helpfulness ratios did not seem well-correlated with the standalone comprehensiveness of the reviews.
But note that this could just mean that at least some of the original helpfulness evaluators were using a different standard of text quality (Amazon does not specify any particular standard or de nition of helpfulness).
Indeed, the exemplary  fair  review quoted by Liu et al. begins,  There is nothing wrong with the [product] except for the very noticeable delay between pics.

It is competent, not spectacu-A different potential approach would be to use machine learning to train an algorithm to automatically determine the degree of helpfulness of each review.
Such an approach would indeed involve less human effort, and could thus be applied to larger numbers of reviews.
However, we could not draw the conclusions we would want to: any mismatch between the predictions of a trained classi- er and the helpfulness ratios observed in held-out reviews could be attributable to errors by the algorithm, rather than to the actions of the Amazon helpfulness evaluators.9 lar, but it gets the job done at an agreeable price point.  Liu et al.
give this a rating of  fair  because it only comments on some of the product s aspects, but the Amazon helpfulness evaluators gave it a helpfulness ratio of 5/6, which seems reasonable.
Also, reviews might also be evaluated vis- -vis the totality of all reviews, i.e., a review might be rated helpful if it provides complementary information or  adds value .
For instance, a one-line review that points out a serious  aw in another review could well be considered  helpful , but would not rate highly under Liu et al. s scheme.
It is also worth pointing out subjectiveness can remain an issue even with respect to a given text-only evaluation scheme.
The two human re-evaluators who used Liu et al. s [2007] standard assigned different helpfulness categories (in a four-category framework) to 619=12.5% of the reviews considered, indicating that there can be substantial subjectiveness involved in determining review quality even when a single standard is initially agreed upon.

Fortunately, we can bring to bear on this problem two key insights:
 ness, we can focus on reviews that are guaranteed to have very similar levels of textual quality.
views [7]   and identical reviews must necessarily exhibit the same level of text quality.
Thus, in the remainder of this section, we consider whether the effects we have analyzed above hold on pairs of  plagiarized  reviews.
Identifying  plagiarism  (as distinct from  justi able copying ).
Our choice of the term  plagiarism  is meant to be somewhat evocative, because we disregard several types of arguably justi able copying or duplication in which there is no overt attempt to make the copied review seem to be a genuinely new piece of text; the reason is because this kind of copying does not suit our purposes.
However, ill intent cannot and should not be ascribed to the authors of the remaining reviews; we have attempted to indicate this by the inclusion of scare quotes around the term.
In brief, we only considered pairs of reviews where the two reviews were posted to different books   this avoids various types of relatively obvious self-copying (e.g., where an author reposts a review under their user ID after initially posting it anonymously), since obvious copies might be evaluated differently.
We next adapted the code of Sorokina et al. [20] to identify those pairs of reviews of different products that have highly similar text.
To do so, we needed to decide on a similarity threshold that determines whether or not we deem a review pair to be  plagiarized .
A reasonable option would have been to consider only reviews with identical text, which would ensure that the reviews in the pairs had exactly the same text quality.
However, since the reviews in the analyzed pairs are posted for different products, it is normal to expect that some authors modi ed or added to the text of the original review to make the  plagiarized  copy better  t its new context.
For this reason, we employed a threshold of 70% or more nearly-duplicate sentences, where near-duplication was measured via the code of Sorokina et al. [20].10 This yielded 8, 313  plagiarized  pairs; an example is shown in Figure 4.
Manual inspection of a sample revealed that the review pairs captured by our threshold indeed seem to consist of close copies.
Con rmation that text quality is not the (only) explanatory factor.
Since for a given pair of  plagiarized  reviews the text quality of the two copies should be essentially the same, a statistically sig-ni cant difference between the helpfulness ratios of the members of such pairs is a strong indicator of the in uence of a non-textual factor on the helpfulness evaluators.
An initial test of the data reveals that the mean difference in helpfulness ratio between  plagiarized  copies is very close to zero.
rather, the algorithm makes mistakes because reviews are more complex in such situations and the classi er uses relatively shallow textual features.
alteration affected their attempts to remove duplicate reviews, used a similar threshold of 80% repeated bigrams.

However, a confounding factor is that for many of our pairs, the two copies may occur in contexts that are practically indistinguishable.
Therefore, we bin the pairs by how different their absolute deviations are, and consider whether helpfulness ratios differ at least for pairs with very different deviations.
More formally, for i, j   {0, 0.5,  , 3.5} where i < j, we write i(cid:31)j (conversely, i j) when the helpfulness ratio of reviews with absolute deviation i is signi cantly larger (conversely, smaller) than that for reviews with absolute deviation j.
Here, signi cantly larger or smaller means that the Mantel-Haenszel test for whether the helpfulness odds ratio is equal to 1 returns a 95% con dence interval that does not contain 1.11 The Mantel-Haenszel test [2] measures the strength of association between two groups, giving more weight to groups with more data.
(Experiments with an alternate empirical sampling test were consistent.)
We disallow j = 4 since there are only relevant 24 pairs which would have to be distributed among 8 (i, j) bins.
The existence of even a single pair (i, j) in which i(cid:31)j or i j would already be inconsistent with the quality-only hypothesis.
Table 1 shows that in fact, there is a signi cant difference in a large majority of cases.
Moreover, we see no   symbols; this is consistent with Figure 1, which showed that the helpfulness ratio is inversely correlated with absolute deviation prior to controlling for text quality.
We also binned the pairs by signed deviation.
The results, shown in Table 2, are consistent with Figure 2.
First, all but one of the statistically signi cant results indicate that  plagiarized  reviews with star rating closer to the product average are judged to be more help-

This  overlap  policy affects only two bins in Table 1 and two bins in Table 2.

Note that the sparsity of the  plagiarism  data precludes an analogous investigation of variance as as a contextual factor.

We now consider how the main  ndings about helpfulness, variance, and divergence from the mean are consistent with a simple model based on individual bias with a mixture of opinion distributions.
In particular, our model exhibits the phenomenon observed in our data that increasing the variance shifts the helpfulness distribution so it is  rst unimodal and subsequently (with larger variance) develops a local minimum around the mean.
The model assumes that helpfulness evaluators can come from two different distributions: one consisting of evaluators who are positively disposed toward the product, and the other consisting of evaluators who are negatively disposed toward the product.
We will refer to these two groups as the positive and negative evaluators respectively.
We need not make speci c distributional assumptions about the evaluators; rather, we simply assume that their opinions are drawn from some underlying distribution with a few basic properties.
Specifically, let us say that a function f : R   R is  centered, for some real number  , if it is unimodal at  , centrally symmetric, and C 2 (i.e. it possesses a continuous second derivative).
That is, f has a unique local maximum at  , f(cid:48) is nonzero everywhere other than  , and f ( +x) = f ( x) for all x.
We will assume that both positive and negative evaluators have one-dimensional opinions drawn from (possibly different) distributions with density functions that are  centered for distinct values of  .
Our model will involve two parameters: the balance between positive and negative reviewers p, and a controversy level   > 0.
Concretely, we assume that there is a p fraction of positive evalua-tors and a 1 p fraction of negative evaluators.
(For notational simplicity, we sometimes write q for 1 p.)
The controversy level controls the distance between the means of the positive and negative populations: we assume that for some number  , the density function f for positive evaluators is (  + q )centered, and the density function g for negative evaluators is (    p )centered.
Thus, the density function for the full population is h(x) = pf (x) + qg(x), and it has mean p(  + q ) + q(    p ) =  .
In this way, our parametrization allows us to keep the mean and balance  xed while observing the effects as we vary the controversy level  .

The  rst (resp.
second) table is consistent with the lefthand (resp.
righthand) side of Figure 2.
The third table is consistent with the  upward slant  of the green lines in Figure 2: for the same absolute deviation value, when there is a sig- ni cant difference in helpfulness odds ratio, the difference is in favor of the positive deviation.
(There are a noticeable number of blank cells, indicating that a statistically signi cant difference was not observed for the corresponding bins, due to sparse data issues: there are twice as many bins as in the absolute-deviation analysis but the same number of pairs.)
Now, under our individual-bias assumption, we posit that each helpfulness evaluator has an opinion x drawn from h, and each regards a review as helpful if it expresses an opinion that is within a small tolerance of x.
For small tolerances, we expect therefore that the helpfulness ratio of reviews giving a score of x, as a function of x, can be approximated by h(x).
Hence, we consider the shape of h(x) and ask whether it resembles the behavior of helpfulness ratios observed in the real data.
Since the controversy level   in our model affects the variance in the empirical data (  is the distance between the peaks of the two distributions, and is thus related to the variance, but the balance p is also a factor), we can hope that at as   increases one obtains qualitative properties consistent with the data:  rst a uni-modal distribution with peak between the means of f and g, and then a local minimum near the mean of h. In fact, this is precisely what happens.
The main result is the following.
THEOREM 5.1.
For any choice of f, g, and p as de ned as above, there exist positive constants  0 <  1 such that (i) When   <  0, the combined density h(x) is unimodal, with maximum strictly between the mean of f and the mean of g.
(ii) When   >  1, the combined density function h(x) has a local minimum between the means of f and g.
Proof.
We  rst prove (i).
Let us write  f =   + q  for the mean of f, and  g =     p  for the mean of g. Since f and g have g(cid:48)(cid:48)( g) < 0.
Since these second derivatives are continuous, there exists a constant   such that f(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) < 0 for all x with |x   f| <  , and g(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) < 0 for all x with |x    g| <  .
Since  f    g =  , if we choose   <  , then f(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) and g(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) are both strictly negative over the entire interval [ g,  f ].
Now, f(cid:48)(x) and g(cid:48)(x) are both positive for x <  g, and they are both negative for x >  f .
Hence h(x) = pf (x) + qg(x) has the properties that (a) h(cid:48)(x) > 0 for x <  g; (b) h(cid:48)(x) < 0 for x >  f , and (c) h(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) < 0 for x   [ g,  f ].
From (a) and (b) it follows that h must achieve its maximum in the interval [ g,  f ], and from (c) it follows that there is a unique local maximum in this interval.
Hence setting  0 =   proves (i).
For (ii), since f and g must both, as density functions that are both centered around their respective means, go to 0 as x increases or decreases arbitrarily, we can choose a constant c large enough that f ( f  x)+g(x+ g) < min(pf ( f ), qg( g)) for all x > c.
If we then choose   > c/ min(p, q), we have  f     > c and      g > c, and so h( ) = pf ( ) + qg( )   f ( ) + g( ) < min(pf ( f ), qg( g))   min(h( f ), h( g)), where the second inequality follows from the de nition of c and our choice of  .
Hence, h is lower at its mean   than at either of  f or  g, and hence it must have a local minimum in the interval [ g,  f ].
This proves (ii) with  1 = c/ min(p, q).
Figure 5: An illustration of Theorem 5.2, using translated Gaussians as an example   the theorem itself does not require any Gaussian assumptions.
For density functions at this level of generality, there is not much one can say about the unimodal shape of h in part (i) of Theorem 5.1.
However, if f and g are translates of the same function, and their next nonzero derivative at 0 is positive, then one can strengthen part (i) to say that the unique maximum occurs between 2 , and between the means of h and the means of h and f when p > 1 g when p < 1
 the additional qualitative observation that for small separations between the functions, it is best to give scores that are slightly above average.
We note that Gaussians are one basic example of a class of density functions satisfying this condition; there are also others.
See Figure 5 for an example in which we plot the mixture when f and g are Gaussian translates, with p  xed but changing   and hence changing the variance.
(Again, it is not necessary to make a Gaussian assumption for anything we do here; the example is purely for the sake of concreteness.)
Speci cally, our second result is the following.
In its statement, we use f (j)(x) to denote the jth derivative of a function f, and recall that we say a function is C j if it has at least j continuous derivatives.
THEOREM 5.2.
Suppose we have the hypotheses of Theorem 5.1, and additionally there is a function k such that f (x) = k(x    f ) and g(x) = k(x   g).
(Hence k is unimodal with its unique local maximum at x = 0.)
Further, suppose that for some j, the function k is C j+1 and we have k(j)(0) > 0 and k(i)(0) = 0 for 2 < i < j.
Then in addition to the conclusions of Theorem 5.1, we also have (i(cid:48)) There exists a constant  (cid:48) 0, the com bined density h(x) has its unique maximum strictly between 2 , and strictly the mean of f and the mean of h when p > 1 between the mean of g and the mean of h when p < 1
 0 such that when   <  (cid:48) Proof.
We omit the proof, which applies Taylor s theorem to k(cid:48), due to space limitations.
We are, of course, not claiming that our model is the only one that would be consistent with the data we observed; our point is simply to show that there exists at least one simple model that exhibits the desired behavior.
In this section we evaluate the robustness of the observed social-effects phenomena by comparing review data from three additional different national Amazon sites: Amazon.co.uk (U.K), Amazon.de (Germany) and Amazon.co.jp (Japan), collected using the same methodology described in Section 2, except that because of the particulars of the AWS API, we were unable to  lter out mechanically cross-posted reviews from the Amazon.co.jp data.
It is reasonable to assume that these reviews were produced independently by four separate populations of reviewers (there exist customers who post reviews to multiple Amazon sites, but such behavior is unusual).
There are noticeable differences between reviews collected from different regional Amazon sites, in both average helpfulness ratio and review variance (Table 3).
The review dynamics in the U.K.
and Japan communities appear to be less controversial than in the U.S. and Germany.
Furthermore, repeating the analysis from Section 3 for these three new datasets reveals the same qualitative patterns observed in the U.S. data and suggested by the model introduced in Section 5.
Curiously enough, for the Japanese data, in contrast to its general reputation of a collectivist culture [4], we observe that the left hump is higher than the right one for reviews with high variance, i.e., reviews with star ratings below the mean are more favored by helpfulness evaluators than the respective reviews with positive deviations (Figure 6).
In the context of our model, this would correspond to a larger proportion of negative evaluators (balance p < 0.5).
We have seen that helpfulness evaluations on a site like Ama-zon.com provide a way to assess how opinions are evaluated by members of an online community at a very large scale.
A review s perceived helpfulness depends not just on its content, but also the relation of its score to other scores.
This dependence on the score contrasts with a number of theories from sociology and social psychology, but is consistent with a simple and natural model of individual bias in the presence of a mixture of opinion distributions.

The curve for Japan has a pronounced lean towards the left.
There are a number of interesting directions for further research.
First, the robustness of our results across independent populations suggests that the phenomenon may be relevant to other settings in which the evaluation of expressed opinions is a key social dynamic.
Moreover, as we have seen in Section 6, variations in the effect (such as the magnitude of deviations above or below the mean) can be used to form hypotheses about differences in the collective behaviors of the underlying populations.
Finally, it would also be very interesting to consider social feedback mechanisms that might be capable of modifying the effects we observe here, and to consider the possible outcomes of such a design problem for systems enabling the expression and dissemination of opinions.
