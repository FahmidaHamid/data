The proposed technique is in principle similar to existing
work on schema matching, e.g. [9], to the extent that it relies
on the same features, i.e. values of attributes. However, the
use of language models for representing these features as well
as the similarity calculation based on entropy is common
for retrieval tasks, but we have not seen them applied to
the schema mapping problem before. We consider this as a
promising approach for embedding the pay-as-you-go data
integration paradigm [16] into the search process.

6. CONCLUSION

We have proposed a novel approach for searching hetero-
geneous Web datasets using one single structured seed query
that adheres to the vocabulary of just one of the datasets.
We have introduced the entity relevance model which cap-
tures the structure and content of relevant results obtained
for a seed query. The entity relevance model is used for
matching and ranking results from external datasets, as well
as for performing data integration on the ﬂy. Our approach
combines the ﬂexibility of keyword search in the sense that
no upfront integration is required, with the power of struc-
tured querying that comes from the use of the ﬁne-grained
structure of query and results. Extensive experiments con-
ducted with real-world datasets show the eﬀectiveness and
feasibility of our approach.

Using our approach allows to take advantage of the struc-
tured data available numerously as Linked Data on the Web
by incorporating these datasources into existing vertical search
capabilities.

As future work, we will extend this approach to allow for
more general queries representing graph patterns. The main
idea will remain the same: building a relevance model from
the seed query, querying external structured data using the
seed query as keywords, and ﬁnally, mapping the structure of
the results to the relevance model to rank them. However,
results here are more complex, involving entities of diﬀer-
ent types that are possibly connected over long paths. We
will employ existing techniques for keyword search on struc-
tured data (e.g. [19]) to retrieve these results, i.e., subgraphs
in the data, which connect entities matching the query key-
words. Also, we will extend our ideas for on-the-ﬂy mapping
and ranking to deal with the more complex structure of the
queries and results.
