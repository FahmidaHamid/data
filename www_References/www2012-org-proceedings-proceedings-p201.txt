A. GIBBS SAMPLER FOR BAYESIAN PREVA-

LENCE MODEL

Gibbs sampling of the Bayesian Prevalence Model, intro-
duced in Section 3.2, is performed according to the following
conditional distributions:

Pr(yi = 1| f (x), y(−i); α, β, γ)

∝ (α1 + N (−i)

and,

Pr(yi = 0| f (x), y(−i); α, β, γ)

∝ (α0 + N (−i)

After sampling, we reconstruct the collapsed variables to
yield the Bayesian Prevalence Model estimate of the preva-
lence of deception:

Estimates of the classiﬁer’s sensitivity and speciﬁcity are
similarly given by:

B. ESTIMATING CLASSIFIER SENSITIV-

ITY AND SPECIFICITY

We estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of our deception

classiﬁer via the following procedure:

1. Assume given a labeled training set, Dtrain, containing
N train reviews of n hotels. Also assume given a devel-
opment set, Ddev, containing labeled truthful reviews.
, of sizes given
con-
j
(−j) con-

, respectively, such that Dtrain
by, N train
tains all (and only) reviews of hotel j. Let Dtrain
tain all reviews except those of hotel j.

2. Split Dtrain into n folds, Dtrain

, . . . ,Dtrain

, . . . , N train

n

3. Then, for each hotel j:

(a) Train a classiﬁer, fj, from reviews in Dtrain

use it to classify reviews in Dtrain

(−j) , and
(b) Let |T P|j correspond to the observed number of

.

j

true positives, i.e.:

(cid:88)

|T P|j =

σ[y = 1] · σ[fj(x) = 1].

(12)

(c) Similarly,

j

(x,y)∈Dtrain
let |F N|j correspond to the observed

number of false negatives.

4. Calculate the aggregate number of true positives (|T P|)
and false negatives (|F N|), and compute the sensitivity
(deceptive recall) as:

|T P|

|T P| + |F N| .

η =

(13)

5. Train a classiﬁer using all reviews in Dtrain, and use it

to classify reviews in Ddev.

6. Let the resulting number of true negative and false
positive predictions in Ddev be given by |T N|dev and
|F P|dev, respectively, and compute the speciﬁcity (truth-
ful recall) as:

θ =

|T N|dev

|T N|dev + |F P|dev

.

(14)

For the Bayesian Prevalence Model, we observe that the
posterior distribution of a variable with an uninformative
(uniform) Beta prior, after observing a successes and b fail-
ures, is just Beta(a+1, b+1), i.e., a and b are pseudo counts.
Based on this observation, we set the hyperparameters β and
γ, corresponding to the classiﬁer’s sensitivity (deceptive re-
call) and speciﬁcity (truthful recall), respectively, to:

β = (cid:104)|F N| + 1,|T P| + 1(cid:105) ,
γ = (cid:104)|F P|dev + 1,|T N|dev + 1(cid:105) .
