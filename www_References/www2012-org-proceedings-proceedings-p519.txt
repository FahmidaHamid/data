Figure 7: Weak ties are collectively more inﬂuen-
tial than strong ties. Panels show the percentage
of information spread by strong and weak ties for
all four measurements of tie strength. Although
the probability of inﬂuence is signiﬁcantly higher
for those that interact frequently, most contagion
occurs along weak ties, which are more abundant.

and exposure to this information on the feed causes a friend
to re-share that same link. (2) Friends visit the same web
page and share a link to that web page on Facebook, inde-
pendently of one another. (3) An individual shares a link
within and external to Facebook, and exposure to the ex-
ternally shared information causes a friend to share the link
on Facebook. Our experiment determines the causal eﬀect
of the feed on the spread of sharing behaviors by comparing
the likelihood of sharing under the feed condition (possible
causes 1-3) with the likelihood under the no feed condition
(possible causes 2-3).

Our experiment generalizes Mark Granovetter’s predic-
tions about the strength of weak ties [22] to the spread of
everyday information. Weak ties are argued to have access
to more diverse information because they are expected to
have fewer mutual contacts; each individual has access to
information that the other does not. For information that
is almost exclusively embedded within few individuals, like
job openings or future strategic plans, weak ties play a nec-
essarily role in facilitating information ﬂow. This reason-
ing, however, does not necessarily apply to the spread of
widely available information, and the relationship between
tie strength and information access is not immediately obvi-
ous. Our experiment sheds light on how tie strength relates
to information access within a broader context, and sug-
gests that weak ties, deﬁned directly in terms of interaction
propensities, diﬀuse novel information that would not have
otherwise spread.

Although weak ties can serve a critical bridging func-
tion [22, 37], the inﬂuence that weak ties exert has never
before been measured empirically at a systemic level. We
