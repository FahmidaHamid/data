APPENDIX

A. PROOF OF THEOREM 2

THEOREM: The content spread function f (X) under the RMPP
model is submodular.

We show that PX (i, c) = 1−Qj∈V (c)(1−qX (j, i)) is submodular.
Since the sum of submodular functions is also submodular, we get
that f (X) = Pc Pi PX (i, c) is submodular.
For edge e and edge subsets S ⊆ T , we are looking to show that
PS∪{e}(i, c) − PS (i, c) ≥ PT ∪{e}(i, c) − PT (i, c). Without loss of
generality, let V (c) = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Recollect that V (c) is the set
of nodes with content c. Furthermore, for edge set T ∪ {e}, let the
RMPPs from only nodes 1, . . . , r to i pass through edge e. We
rely on the following three observations for proving that PX (i, c)
is submodular.
1. (a) qT (j, i) ≥ qS (j, i), (b) qT ∪{e}(j, i) ≥ qS∪{e}(j, i), and (c)
qS∪{e}(j, i) ≥ qS (j, i). Probability of RMPPs cannot decrease
with the addition of new edges.
2. qS∪{e}(j, i) = qT ∪{e}(j, i), j ≤ r. With the restriction of at

the most one new edge per RMPP, the RMPPs from j to i for
edge set S ∪ {e} also pass through e and are identical to those for
T ∪ {e}.
3. qT ∪{e}(j, i) = qT (j, i), j > r. RMPPs from j to i for T ∪ {e}
that do not contain edge e must be identical to the ones for T .

Now, PT ∪{e}(i, c) − PT (i, c)

Thus, f (·) is submodular.

B. PROOF OF THEOREM 4

THEOREM: Let |V | = n, δ = m2 and r = m5. Further, let our
partitioning scheme generate edge sets X1, . . . , Xs. Then w.h.p.
E[maxi f (Xi)] ≥ 1
k log(n).

3+2ǫ · (1 − 1

Consider the set X obtained as a result of our randomized round-
ing procedure. Due to Theorem 3, we have that E[f (X)] ≥
(1 − 1

e ) · f (Xopt).

Now, let Yj be the number of edges in X incident on node
j. Also, let ǫ = q 8
k log(n). Recall that an arbitrary edge ei
is included in X with probability yi. Further, since ¯y is feasible,
Pj∈ei
yi ≤ k for all nodes j. Thus, E[Yj ] ≤ k. Applying Chernoﬀ
Bounds, we get

P (Yj ≥ (1 + ǫ) · E[Yj ]) < exp(−

Since E[Yj ] ≤ k, we get

P (Yj ≥ (1 + ǫ) · k) < exp(−

E[Yj ] · ǫ2

k · ǫ2

Now deﬁne Ymax = maxj {Yj }. By the union bound, we get that

P (Ymax ≥ (1 + ǫ) · k) < n · exp(−

n ) for ǫ = q 4
The above probability is extremely small (≤ 1
Thus, we get that w.h.p. Yj ≤ (1 + ǫ) · k for all nodes j.

k log(n2).

Next, we show that our partioning scheme divides set X into
at most 2ǫ + 3 feasible sets Xi. This is because w.h.p., for any
edge (u, v) ∈ X, at most 1 + ǫ sets Xi can have k edges incident
on each of the vertices u and v (since Yj ≤ (1 + ǫ) · k). Thus,
w.h.p., in at least one of the 2ǫ + 3 sets Xi, both u and v must
have fewer than k incident edges, and so Xi ∪ {(u, v)} is feasible.

Now, since f (·) is submodular, we have that Pi f (Xi) ≥ f (∪iXi).

Furthermore, there are at most 2ǫ + 3 feasible sets Xi. Thus, we
get that maxi f (Xi) ≥ f (X)
3+2ǫ · (1 −
1
e ) · f (Xopt).

2ǫ+3 , and so E[maxi f (Xi)] ≥ 1
