8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper has four novel contributions:
• Modeling Aggregators: Aggregation is an important and grow-
ing phenomenon in the web milieu. We provide the ﬁrst
model of aggregator incentives. The only earlier paper we
know of [4] is a paper on the interaction between aggregators
and content providers. While this is important, it does not
provide insight into why aggregators enter. The two games
are orthogonal and should ideally be combined.

• Jacquard distance for location games: While we fundamen-
tally model the entrance of aggregators and users as a lo-
cation game, we are the ﬁrst to model distance as Jacquard
distance and not Euclidean distance. This is not merely an
esoteric choice for novelty but, we believe, a more realistic
model of user taste sets than Euclidean distance in any di-
mensional space. We believe our location game, invented
to model aggregators, applies to other parts of economics as
well in which specialized stores (e.g., grocery stores) steal
users from general stores (e.g., Walmart).

• Safe satisﬁcing strategies: In the course of this paper, we
found it natural to invent safe satisﬁcing strategies. Satisﬁc-
ing is well known in economics; so also are extensive form
games. We claim that it is perfectly natural to marry these
two concepts.
In particular, this is because computing an
SPNE is typically exponential in the size of the lattice. To put
this into perspective, even for the simple snowﬂake example
with 12 nodes, the size of the lattice is 1024 and the size of
the game tree is 1024 factorial (the amount of time required
to search the game tree), an astronomically large number.
While in practice, there are heuristics such as branch-and-
bound, computing SPNEs with the best known algorithms
appears very hard. By contrast, we have shown a non-trivial
algorithm for the FMT game that is very fast (N log N ver-
sus N !) that at least prevents loss if all subsequent players
also have positive proﬁts. Could there be simpler game tree
strategies for other games as well that are safe satisﬁcing?
Recall also our conjecture that a satisﬁcing strategy is a Nash
equilibrium of a game with modiﬁed payoffs—that are a ﬁrst
order approximation, the sign function, of the original payoff
function.
Satisﬁcing strategies can also be viewed from the lens of
computer science. Just as there exist polynomial time ap-
proximation algorithms for so-called NP complete algorithms
(whose best known solutions are exponential in the input),
perhaps satisﬁcing algorithms introduce another notion of
approximation to algorithmic game theory, in addition to the
standard -Nash.

• FMT and ET games: We have made progress on the analysis
of aggregator games. We have shown that the FMT game
has an N log N satisﬁcing solution which is not an SPNE.
At least one player will enter if the revenue is more than the
ﬁxed cost, and no revenue is wasted. We have shown by
contrast that the ET game has no satisﬁcing solution.

In conclusion, we note that Frontier Descent provides some in-
tuition into the evolution of aggregation on the real web. In some
sense, the sequence of entries from say Yahoo to TechCrunch to
AppleInsider is a form of descent. And yet large aggregators such
as Yahoo remain proﬁtable (as do general stores like Walmart) per-
haps because they aggregate the long tail of content that does not
