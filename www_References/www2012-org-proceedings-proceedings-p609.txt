a higher-order Markov chain. To this end, we use the computed
MLE matrix and the fact we proved about the stationary of the MLE
Markov chain in order to compute the probability of predicting it
accurately. For ease of interpretation, we present the results rela-
tive to the prediction probability for k = 1. Figure 10 shows the
results. The improvements are signiﬁcant (40% with order 2-3) for
MouseTrack and very minimal for EyeTrack; once again, the two-
dimensional browsing aspect of EyeTrack makes it hard to predict
well. For NYTimes, we get around 10% improvement for k = 3,
but for Yahoo, the behavior seems more intricate. This remains the
subject of future investigation.
