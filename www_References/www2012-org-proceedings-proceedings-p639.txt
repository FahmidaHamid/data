Figure 3: This table shows precision and recall values for each processed question (i.e. all questions that do
not require the YAGO or FOAF namespace). For questions with no precision and recall speciﬁed, no query
was constructed. Questions printed in cells with red background were not parsed, questions in white cells

succeeded and for questions in lightgray cells queries with quality equal or close to the Gold query were

built, while questions in yellow cells fail due to a query selection problem and questions in orange cells fail
due to some entity identiﬁcation problem.
