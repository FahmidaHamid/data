Theorem 4 The direct mapping DMpk+fk is information preserv-
ing, query preserving and semantics preserving.

Information preservation and query preservation of DMpk+fk are
corollaries of the fact that these properties hold for DM and DMpk.
A direct mapping that satisﬁes the four properties can be ob-
tained by considering an alternative semantics of OWL that ex-
presses integrity constraints. Because OWL is based on Description
Logic, we would need a version of DL that supports integrity con-
straints, which is not a new idea. Integrity constraints are epistemic
in nature and are about “what the knowledge base knows” [18].
Extending DL with the epistemic operator K has been studied [7,
9, 10]. Grimm et al. proposed to extend the semantics of OWL
to support the epistemic operator [11]. Motik et al. proposed to
write integrity constraints as standard OWL axioms but interpreted
with different semantics for data validation purposes [15]. Tao et
al. showed that integrity constraint validation can be reduced to
SPARQL query answering [22]. Recently, Mehdi et al. introduced
a way to answer epistemic queries to restricted OWL ontologies
[14]. Thus, it is possible to extend DMpk to create an information
preserving, query preserving and monotone direct mapping that is
also semantics preserving, but it is based on a non-standard version
of OWL including the epistemic operator K.

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we study how to directly map relational databases to
an RDF graph with OWL vocabulary based on two fundamental
properties (information preservation and query preservation) and
two desirable properties (monotonicity and semantics preservation).
We ﬁrst present a monotone, information preserving and query pre-
serving direct mapping considering databases that have null values.
Then we prove that the combination of monotonicity with the OWL
semantics is an obstacle to generating a semantics preserving direct
mapping. Finally, we overcome this obstacle by presenting a non-
monotone direct mapping that is semantics preserving, and also by
discussing the possibility of generating a monotone mapping that
assumes an extension of OWL with the epistemic operator.

Related Work: Several approaches directly map relational schemas
to RDFS and OWL. We refer the reader to the following survey
[20]. D2R Server has an option that directly maps the relational
database into RDF, however this process is not documented [2].
RDBToOnto presents a direct mapping that mines the content of
the relational databases in order to learn ontologies with deeper
taxonomies [8]. Currently, the W3C RDB2RDF Working Group
is developing a direct mapping standard that focuses on translating
relational database instances to RDF [5, 6].

Future Work: We would like to extend our direct mapping to con-
sider datatypes, relational databases under bag semantics and eval-
uate this rule based approach on large relational databases. The ex-
tension of our direct mapping to bag semantics is straightforward.
In our setting each tuple has its own identiﬁer, which is represented
in the VALUE predicate. Thus, even if repeated tuples exist, each
tuple will still have its unique identiﬁer and, therefore, exactly the
same rules can be used to map relational data under bag semantics.
