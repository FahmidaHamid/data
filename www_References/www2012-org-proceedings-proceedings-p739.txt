Figure 6: The network block matrix for the ACL Anthology
Data. Blocks corresponding to links within/between A3 and

only 343 links between them.

theoretical frameworks, such as centering theory and propositional
semantics (not shown here).

Occasionally, seemingly related topics are split into different
parts of the tree. For example, the keywords for both topics A3
and A6.1 relate to syntactic parsing. Nonetheless, the citation links
between these two topics are relatively sparse (see Figure 6), re-
vealing a more subtle distinction: A3 focuses on representations
and rule-driven approaches, while A6.1 includes data-driven and
statistical approaches.

As in the Wikipedia data, the network diagram (Figure 6) reveals
evidence of hierarchical block structures. For example, A2 contains
4101 links out of 4.4 million possible, a density of 9.3∗ 10
−4. This
is substantially larger than the background density 1.8 ∗ 10
−4, but
less than subtopics such as A2.1, which has a density of 6.4∗ 10
−3.
We observe similar multilevel density for most of the high-level
topics, except for interactive systems (A1), which seems to be more
fractured. One of the densest topics is machine translation (A8),
an area of computational linguistics which has become sufﬁciently
distinct as to host its own conferences.5

One could obtain more parallel structure by imposing a domain-
speciﬁc solution for research papers, such as Gupta and Manning’s
work on identifying the “focus, technique, and domain” of each
article [15]; of course, such a solution would not necessarily gen-
eralize to Wikipedia articles or other document collections. While
parallel structure is desirable, it is often lacking even in taxonomies
produced by human experts. For example, a similar critique might
be leveled at the sessions associated with a research conference, or
even the ACM taxonomy.6

8. CONCLUSION

We have presented TopicBlock, a hierarchical nonparametric model

for text and network data. By treating these two modalities jointly,
we not only obtain a more robust latent representation, but are also
able to better understand the relationship between the text and links.
Applications such as link prediction, document clustering, and link
ambiguity resolution demonstrate the strengths of our approach.
In the future we plan to consider richer structures, such as mul-
tiple hierarchies which capture alternative possible decompositions
