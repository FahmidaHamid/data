5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose using the massive collections of user-
generated photos uploaded to social sharing websites as a source
of observational evidence about the world, and in particular as a
way of estimating the presence of ecological phenomena. As a ﬁrst
step towards this long-term goal, we used a collection of 150 mil-
lion geo-tagged, timestamped photos from Flickr to estimate snow
cover and greenery, and compared these estimates to ﬁne-grained
ground truth collected by earth-observing satellites and ground sta-
tions. We compared several techniques for performing the estima-
tion from noisy, biased data, including simple voting mechanisms
and a Bayesian likelihood ratio. We also tested several possible
improvements to these basic methods, including using temporal
smoothing and machine learning to improve the accuracy of esti-
mates. We found that while the recall is relatively low due to the
sparsity of photos on any given day, the precision can be quite high,
suggesting that mining from photo sharing websites could be a re-
liable source of observational data for ecological and other scien-
tiﬁc research. In future work, we plan to study additional features
including using more sophisticated computer vision techniques to
analyze visual content. Also we plan to study a variety of other eco-
logical phenomena, including those for which high quality ground
truth is not available, such as migration patterns of wildlife and the
distributions of blooming ﬂowers.
