Classiﬁcation-enhanced ranking. In Proceedings of the
19th international conference on World wide web,
WWW ’10, pages 111–120, Raleigh, NC, 2010. ACM.

When ranking categories by Equation (9), for gender, we
found Shopping/{Jewelry, Health, Pets, Craft}, Arts/Design,
and Society/Relationship as the most inﬂuential categories
for classifying females. For males, Shopping/Gift, Sports
sub-categories, Games and Recreation/Guns had the highest
inﬂuence. For political views, Politics/Conservatism, and
Society/{Military, Politics, Religion and Spirituality} had
the highest β scores for conservatives, while for liberals So-
ciety/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual, Politics/Liberalism, and
Computers/Artiﬁcial Intelligence were ranked highest.

For age, Kids and Teens/Health had the highest β among
teenagers. Adult/Society and Sports/Wrestling were the
highest-ranked categories for youngs and youngsters. Shop-
ping/Jewellery, and Business/Hospitality were closely ranked
on top for mid-age users, while Shopping/Ethnic and Regional
and News/Media were the top two for elders.

Finally for religion, Religion and Spirituality/Christianity,
and Religion and Spirituality/Scientology had respectively
the highest bias towards Christians and Buddhists. For
Jews, somewhat surprisingly Computers/Computer Science
was ranked highest, while agnostics had the strongest nega-
tive biases towards Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies,
and Religion and Spirituality/Scientology.

8. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we addressed the problem of inferring users
traits – namely age, gender, religion and political view –
