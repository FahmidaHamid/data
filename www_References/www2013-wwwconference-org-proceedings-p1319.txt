A. THE GENERALIZED SFP MODEL

A.1 Model Deﬁnition

In Figure 4 we showed the slopes ρ of the OR ﬁtting for the IEDs
of all individuals of our datasets. It is fascinating that the typical ρi
for the individuals of seven of our eight datasets is approximately
1, the same slope generated by the SFP model. Several individuals
though, mainly from the SMS dataset, have a much higher value of
ρ, close to ρ ≈ 2. To accommodate that and all the variance seen
in the data, we introduce our Generalized SFP model, which needs
just one parameter more, ρ. Thus, we have:

Model 2. Generalized Self-Feeding Process S FP(µ, ρ).

δ1 ← µ
δt ← Exponential (mean: β = δt−1 + µρ/e)
∆k ← δ1/ρ

.

t

Note the auxiliary variable δt, which stores the inter-event times

without the inﬂuence of ρ.

A.2 Parameters

Before reaching the full SFP model described in the paper, we
had a simpler version of it, relying on a diﬀerent parametrization
scheme:

Model 3. Self-Feeding Process SFP (C,a).

δ1 ← C
δt ← Poisson Process(β = δt−1 + C)
∆k ← δa
t ,

(4)

where C is the location parameter and a is the shape parameter
that deﬁnes the odds ratio slope ρ. An easy and direct way to deﬁne
the relationships between this model’s parameters and the distribu-
tion properties µ and ρ is through simulations.

Thus, the ﬁrst point we consider is the median µ of the inter-event
times generated by the SFP model when a = 0. When OR(x) = 1, x
is the median µ of the distribution. Thus, in Figure 11-a, we plot the
OR for diﬀerent values of C. We observe that changing the value
of C changes µ and, consequently, the location of the distribution,
but maintains its slope. We also see that µ is close but diﬀerent than
the value of C.

In order to investigate the relationship between C and µ, we
run simulations of the model for all integer values of C between
[1,10000]. As we observe in Figure 11-b, the median µ of the inter-
event times distribution (IED) varies linearly with C according to a
slope of ≈ 2.72, that can be approximated by Euler’s number e, in
a way that µ ∝ e × C. This allows us to generate inter-event times
with a determined µ when the slope ρ = 1. We ignore the constant
factor 3.8 because its 95% conﬁdence interval is (−8.596, 16.3),
which contains zero.

(a) The OR of the IED for dif-
ferent values of C

(b) µ as a function of C

Figure 11: Changing the value of C changes the location of the
distribution. The median of the distribution µ varies linearly
with C, µ = a × C + b, with a = 2.719 and b = 3.8. The 95% con-
ﬁdence interval for a is (2.715, 2.723) and for b is (−8.60, 16.3).
Since the conﬁdence interval for b contains 0, b is not signiﬁ-
cant.

Now we know how to generate inter-event times with diﬀerent
medians µ using the parameter C = µ/e of SFP. The next step is to
verify how the SFP model can generate IEDs with a desired slope
ρ , 1. Considering that up to this point the SFP model generates
a set of inter-event times I1 with a slope 1, the idea is to use an
exponent a to transform I1 into Iρ, which is an IED with a diﬀerent
slope ρ. When we elevate each ∆k ∈ I1 to the power of a , 1, the
resulting slope ρ becomes diﬀerent than 1, as we see in Figure 12-a.
In the same way we did for C, we run simulations of the model for
1000 diﬀerent values of a ∈ [0.1, 2]. As we observe in Figure 12-
b, there is an inverse relationship between a and ρ, i.e., ρ = a−1.
Moreover, since the median of the distribution is also elevated to
the power of a, we have to elevate the parameter µ to the power of
ρ = a−1 to preserve the median.

A.3 The need for the constant µ/e in SFP

Lemma 1. The constant C = µ/e > 0 of Model 3 is needed to
assure that the inter-event times generated by the SFP model will
not converge to zero.

Proof. If we remove the constant C from Model 2, ∆k = (∆k−1)×
(− ln(U(0, 1))), or ∆k will be equal to ∆k−1 multiplied by a random
number X extracted from the exponential distribution with param-
eter β = λ = 1. If (X = 1
k | k > 1), then ∆k will be equal to ∆k−1
k = 1
divided by k. The probability of X to be 1
.
k√e
On the other hand, the probability of multiplying ∆k by k and, there-
fore, return ∆k+1 to ∆k−1 value is P(X = k) = e−k = 1
ek . Given

these probabilities, observe that P(X = 1

ek , ∀k > 1. From this, we conclude that the expected value of ∆k
when t → ∞ is 0. With C in the equation, even when ∆k−1 = 0,
∆k = −C × ln(U(0, 1), that is a classic Poisson process with β = C,
and, obviously, does not converge to 0.

A.4 Lower Temporal Correlation

The SFP model is build upon a direct dependence between con-
secutive inter-event times. Because of that, the correlation between
consecutive inter-event times is signiﬁcantly higher than real data.
While the average Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient for real data is
approximately 0.4, for synthetic data generated by the SFP model
it is approximately 0.7. In order to generate more realistic data,
we suggest a slight modiﬁcation of the SFP process.
Instead of
generating the next inter-event time (∆k) based on the immediate
previous one (∆k−1), we propose that it should be generated from a
ǫ-th previous one (∆k−ǫ ). This can be done by extracting ǫ from an
exponential distribution with mean β = 1 and making its ceiling, so
the lower bound for ǫ is 1. In summary, the SFP model is changed
as follows:

Model 4. Self-Feeding Process* SFP*(µ).
//µ is the desired median of the marginal PDF

∆1 ← µ
ǫ ← ⌈Exponential (mean β = 1)⌉
∆k ← Exponential (mean β = ∆k−ǫ + µ/e)

Observe in Figure 13 that the synthetic data generate by the SFP*
has a lower correlation (0.43) between consecutive inter-event times
than the original one (0.70). Despite of that, the odds ratio gener-
ated by the SFP* is still a power law with slope ρ ≈ 1.

exp(−x/(y + µρ/e)) f (y)dy

This integral equation has no obvious analytical solution but in the
next sections we show via simulations of the point process that f (x)
is very well approximated by a log-logistic density. This mathemat-
ical diﬃculty is common in the previous attempts to model data
with Wold processes. Even if a consistent density f (x) and a tran-
sition kernel f (y → x) are given, properties are, in general, diﬃcult
to obtain [9].

B.2 Fitting Synthetic Data

In Figure 14-a, we plot the histogram of 100,000 time intervals
∆k generated by the SFP model with µ = e. Moreover, in Figure 14-
b, we plot the OR for the same time intervals. While a classic PP
generates an exponential distribution, we observe that the generated
data by the SFP perfectly ﬁts a distribution with an Odds Ratio
function that is a power law with slope ρ = 1. Thus, we propose
the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1. The SFP model generates a log-logistic distri-

B. THE SFP STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION

bution with ρ = σ = 1,

B.1 Analytical Result

The SFP model is within the general class of Wold processes
deﬁned as processes with Markov-dependent interevents intervals
[41, 10]. These processes have not been extensively studied in the
literature, perhaps due to the mathematical diﬃculties in deriving
their probabilistic properties. Consider the existence of a stationary
distribution for the generalized SFP model. A stationary PDF f (x)

where σ is the shape parameter of the log-logistic distribution.

We have several and signiﬁcant evidences that the SFP generates
a log-logistic distribution, but at this moment we do not have a
formal analytical proof that this is true.

B.3 The SFP Markov Chain

The SFP can be naturally considered as a Markov Chain (MC),
since it is a sequence of random variables ∆1, ∆2, ∆3, ... with the

the slope ρ = σ = 1.

Markov property, namely that, given the present inter-event time,
or state, the future and past inter-event times, or states, are inde-
pendent. Thus, here we model the SFP as a time-homogeneous
Markov chain with a ﬁnite state space to give another evidence that
the SFP has a stationary distribution and that it is very likely that
this distribution is the log-logistic.

Originally, the SFP can be considered as a continuous-time MC,
but for simplicity, we build a discrete-time Markov chain in a way
that each state ∆i = {∆1, ∆2, ∆3, ...} represents the inter-event times
with values within the interval (i − 1, i]. For instance, considering
the granularity in seconds, if the current inter-event time is 3.8 sec-
onds, then the MC is in the state ∆4. Also for simplicity, we build a
ﬁnite-state MC with a maximum number of states n, i.e., the states
go from ∆1 to ∆n. The MC will be in state ∆n every time the current
inter-event time is within the interval (n, ∞).
Thus, considering a n-state MC build from the SFP model, the
transitions probabilities pi, j of going from state ∆i to ∆ j are given
in the following way:

pi, j = ( CDFexp(x=j,β=i+C) − CDFexp(x=j-1,β=i+C)

1 − CDFexp(x=j,β=i+C)

if j<n
if j=n,

where CDFexp(x, β) is the cumulative distribution function of the
exponential distribution on x with mean β and C = µ/e, given by
the SFP (Equation 1). Observe in Figure 15 that the probability
density function of the log-logistic is virtually identical to the one
of the stationary distribution of the SFP Markov Chain. This is an-
other strong indication that the SFP generates log-logistically dis-
tributed data.

Figure 15: The probability density function of the log-logistic
distribution and the stationary distribution of the SFP MC.

It is important to point out that in [6] the authors showed that the
behavior of Web users is not Markovian, i.e., a user’s next action
does not depends only on her/his current state. Our assumption
diﬀers from this one because we assume that users have Markovian

behavior in communications, while [6] studied whether users have
Markovian behavior while navigating on the Web.

B.4 Log-logistic Distribution

The log-logistic distribution was ﬁrst proposed by Fisk [14] to
model income distribution, after observing that the OR plot of real
data in log-log scales follows a power law OR(x) = cxρ. In sum-
mary, a random variable is log-logistically distributed if the log-
arithm of the random variable is logistically distributed. The lo-
gistic distribution is very similar to the normal distribution, but it
has heavier tails. In the literature, there are examples of the use
of the log-logistic distribution in survival analysis [3, 29], distribu-
tion of wealth [14], ﬂood frequency analysis [33], software relia-
bility [16] and phone calls duration [38]. A commonly used log-
logistic parametrization is [26]:

PDFLLG(x) =
CDFLLG(x) =

z = (ln(x) − ln(µ))/σ,

ez

σx(1+ez)2 ,
1+e−z ,

1

(5)

where σ = 1/ρ, the slope of our SFP model, and µ is the same.
Moreover, when σ = 1, it is the same distribution as the Gener-
alized Pareto distribution [28] with shape parameter κ = 1, scale
parameter µ and threshold parameter θ = 0.

B.5 SFP has Power Law Tail

The universality class model proposed by Barabási [2] states that
the IED has a power law tail. The proposed SFP model agrees with
this model in a way that:

Lemma 2. If Conjecture 1 is correct, then the SFP model gen-
erates an IED that converges to a power law when x → ∞, i.e.,
limx→∞

= k, where k is a constant greater than 0.

PDFLLG (x)

x−α

Proof. Considering the Probability Density Function of the log-
logistic distribution showed in Equation 5, if we set the location
parameter µ = 1 for simplicity, ez = x1/σ. Then, PDFLLG(x) can be
simpliﬁed to

PDFLLG(x) =

1

σ −1

x

σ(1 + x

1
σ )2

.

When x → ∞, the addition of 1 in the denominator can be disre-
garded, resulting in the following simpliﬁcation:

PDFLLG(x) =

x−(1+1/σ)

σ

, x → ∞.

Thus, when x → ∞, the IED generated by the SFP model is a power
law with slope

α = −(1 + 1/σ) = −(1 + ρ).

Observe again Figure 14-a and note the power law tail.

C. SFP CODE

Below we show the Python code for the SFP generator.

def SFP(n, mu, rho=1):

#first inter-event time
deltat = mu
#list of inter-event times
Deltat = []
for i in range(1, n):

#Poisson Process which Beta=deltat+mu/e
deltat = -(deltat+(mu**rho)/math.e)
deltat = deltat * math.log(random.random())
Deltat.append(deltat**(1/rho))

return Deltat
