APPENDIX
A. PROOF OF THEOREM 5.2

Notice that Deﬁnition 5.1 requires immediately that the any well-
behaved group chat pass the cohesion test. Further, any well-behaved
group chat will pass the test for being synchronized: Algorithm 3
will accept the chat because β(0) ≥ mnmin/(mnmin + (m −
1)n−) ≥ γ. The only real difﬁculty is in showing that (the modiﬁ-
cation of) Algorithm 2 will accept the timeline of tweets. Lemma A.1
completes this last step, and the remainder of this section is devoted
to its statement and proof.

PROOF. The periodicity coefﬁcient of a period S(τ ) is the prod-
uct of two terms, which we analyze in Sections A.2 (Fourier) and
A.1 (autocorrelation). The lower bound (5) on the true period’s
coefﬁcient follows from Lemmas A.2 and A.7. The bound (6) on
other coefﬁcients τ(cid:48) is proved in cases. For τ(cid:48) ∈ [l, τ − l] ∪ [τ + l,
2τ − l], Lemma A.3 gives S(τ(cid:48)) ≤ |Af (τ(cid:48))|/|Af (0)| ≤ 3ρ.
The remaining case is that τ(cid:48) ≥ 2τ − l. We begin by approxi-
mating the term s = 2| sin πτ ξ| from the statement of Lemma A.8,
where ξ = 1/τ(cid:48). By the concavity of the sine function on [0, π], we

have sin ψπ ≥ ψ for ψ ∈ [0, 2
have s ≥ 2τ /τ(cid:48). If τ(cid:48) > mτ, then by Lemma A.4 the periodicity
coefﬁcient is zero. Otherwise,

A.1 Results about Autocorrelation

Here we state results which say that the autocorrelation of the
true period is high, and that the autocorrelations of certain other
periods are low. We assume f satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theo-
rem 5.2. Proofs omitted for brevity.

LEMMA A.2. |Af (τ )|/|Af (0)| ≥ 1/(2η2).
LEMMA A.3. Let τ(cid:48) be a period, and assume meetings in the
timeline f (t) are disjoint from meetings in the timeline f (t − τ(cid:48)).
Then |Af (τ(cid:48))|/|Af (0)| ≤ 2mρ/(m − 1).

A.2 Results about Fourier Coefﬁcients

|(cid:82) ∞

Here we state analogous results to those in Section A.1, but about
Fourier coefﬁcients. The notation f will represent the timeline of
a well-behaved group chat. Note that for any function g, |ˆg(0)| =
−∞ g(x)dx|: for timelines, the total number of tweets.
PROPOSITION A.5
Suppose g = g+ + g−. Then, for any frequency ξ, we have |ˆg(ξ)−
ˆg+(ξ)| ≤ |ˆg−(ξ)| ≤ | ˆg−(0)|.

(EFFECT OF NOISE).

PROPOSITION A.6

(EFFECT OF TIMING WITHIN MEETINGS).
Consider a timeline g consisting of α tweets at times t0, . . . , tα,
and a distorted version g(cid:48) with tweets at times t(cid:48)
α, where
∀j |tj − t(cid:48)
j| < l. Note that ˆg(0) = ˆg(cid:48)(0). (Think of g with tweets at
starts of meetings, and g(cid:48) with tweets throughout meetings.) Then,
for any frequency ξ, |ˆg(ξ) − ˆg(cid:48)(ξ)| < 2πlξα.
Combining Propositions A.5 and A.6, we have:

0, . . . , t(cid:48)

LEMMA A.7

| ˆf (1/τ )| ≥ (1 − 2πl/τ − ρ)α, where α is the number of tweets.

(THE CORRECT FOURIER COEFFICIENT).

234PROOF. Let  = l∗ − l. We divide the interval [0, τ ] into over-
lapping intervals I1 = [0, l∗], I2 = [, l∗ + ], . . . . (If an interval
[a, b] has b > τ, we consider it to “wrap around”: we replace it
by [0, b − τ ] ∪ [a, τ ], since Algorithm 3 works modulo τ.) There
are a total of τ / such intervals. Notice that any interval of length
l must fall completely into one of these intervals: so it sufﬁces to
show that at most a γ fraction of messages will fall in any of the
intervals Ij, and then take a union bound, losing a factor of τ /.

We can think of the message times as being generated as follows:
ﬁrst, the total number of messages α is sampled from a Poisson dis-
tribution with rate |λ|1, and then each message time t1, . . . , tα is
sampled independently from the probability distribution λ(t)/|λ|1.
Then with high probability, we have α > |λ|1/2. A Chernoff
bound shows that at most a γ fraction of these will fall in a given
interval Ij with probability 2−Ω(α).

Combining Lemmas B.1 and B.2, we have the following:

LEMMA B.3. Let λ be a rate function that is periodic with a pe-
riod of one day on the interval [0, m days], and is (γ/2 − , l + )-
diffuse on the interval [0, 1 day] (where γ and l are parameters of
the algorithm, and  is any positive constant). Then with probabil-
ity 1 − O(1)2−Ω(|λ|1), a timeline sampled with rate λ(t) will be
rejected by Algorithm 3 for any period τ which is at least one day.
(The coefﬁcients in the O and Ω depend on  and the parameters of
the algorithm.)
B.2 Non-regular messages

LEMMA B.4. Let f be the timeline of a set of messages gener-
ated according to the non-regular model. Assume the threshold γ
of Algorithm 3 is strictly greater than 2l/τmin, where τmin is the
shortest period considered by Algorithm 2. Then with probability
1 − O(1)2−Ω(T λ), Algorithm 3 (and therefore Algorithm 1) will
reject f. The coefﬁcients in the O and Ω depend on γ, l and τmin.
PROOF. We follow a similar strategy to the proof of Lemma B.2,
except that in order to bound the number of messages that occur
in an interval I = [a, a + l∗], we instead bound the number of
meetings that start at any point in the interval [a− l, a + l∗]. This is
sufﬁcient, since only those meetings can have any messages in the
interval I.
First, let τ ≥ τmin be the period found by Algorithm 2. Set
l∗ = γτmin/2 > l, and set  = l∗ − l. As before, we divide [0, τ ]
into τ / different intervals I1 = [0, l∗], I2 = [, l∗ + ], . . . . It is
enough to show that after compression (mapping each time to one
in the interval [0, τ ]) at most a γ fraction of the messages will fall
in any interval Ij; then we complete the proof by taking a union
bound.
To bound the number of tweets that arrive in an interval Ij =
[a, a + l∗], it is enough to bound the number of meetings that start
j = [a − l, a + l∗], since only such meetings can
in the interval I(cid:48)
contribute messages to the interval Ij. This can be done in the same
way as in the proof of Lemma B.2.

Finally, we show:

LEMMA A.8

(THE WRONG FOURIER COEFFICIENTS). Let ξ

−1) + m(nmax − nmin) + (m− 1)n−.

be any frequency, and let s = 2| sin πτ ξ|. Then,
| ˆf (ξ)| < nmin(2πlξm + 2s
In particular, if m ≥ 3, then
−1 + 3(η + ρ − 1)/2(ρ + 1).
| ˆf (ξ)|/| ˆf (0)| < 2πlξ + 2s
PROOF. We will replace f by a simpler version fsimple. This
version will have no tweets between meetings. Every meeting will
have the same number of tweets nmin, and all the tweets will hap-
pen at meeting starts. Fourier coefﬁcients of fsimple behave well,
and we can relate fsimple to f using Propositions A.5 and A.6.

Let f+ consist of tweets during meetings and f− the other tweets.
Now, change f+ to have nmin tweets in every meeting, by remov-
ing tweets from meetings that have more. Let f∗

B. PROOF OF THEOREM 5.6

The case of a non-coherent set of messages is trivial (our algo-
rithm explicitly rejects such hashtags). Lemmas B.3 and B.4 com-
plete the proof in the case of the non-synchronized and non-regular
models.
B.1 Non-synchronized messages

For a rate function λ(t), let |λ|1 =(cid:82) ∞

We will think of Algorithm 3 as having two parts. First, a hash-
tag’s timeline is compressed over an interval τ: each message time
ti is replaced with a message time 0 ≤ t(cid:48)
i < τ by subtracting a
multiple of the period τ. Second, the algorithm checks whether the
resulting timeline (t(cid:48)
i) is (γ, l)-diffuse, and if so, classiﬁes the hash-
tag as a non-group chat. Lemma B.1 will show that the timeline
remains diffuse after the compression step, and then Lemma B.2
shows that Algorithm 3 will reject the hashtag with high probabil-
ity.

−∞ λ(t)dt.

compressed function λτ (t) = (cid:80)(cid:100)mσ/τ(cid:101)

LEMMA B.1. Let λ be a function which is periodic with period
σ over the interval [0, mσ]. Assume λ is (γ∗, l)-diffuse over the
interval [0, σ]. Given a possibly longer period τ ≥ σ, deﬁne the
λ(t + iτ ). Then λτ is
(2γ∗, l)-diffuse over [0, τ ].

i=0

We omit the proof due to space constraints.

LEMMA B.2. Suppose λ(t) is (γ∗, l∗)-diffuse on an interval
[0, τ ], and γ > γ∗ and l < l∗. If timeline t is sampled with a
Poisson process of varying rate λ(t), then t is (γ, l)-diffuse with
probability 1 − O(1)2−Ω(|λ|1). (The coefﬁcients in the O and Ω
depend on γ∗, γ, l∗/τ and l/τ.)
