10. APPENDIX

TRIPLE [37] is a rule language for the Semantic Web which is
based on Horn logic and borrows many basic features from F-Logic
[29] but is especially designed for querying and transforming RDF
models. TRIPLE can be viewed as a successor of SiLRI (Simple
Logic-based RDF Interpreter [15]). One of the most important dif-
ferences to F-Logic and SiLRI is that TRIPLE does not have ﬁxed
semantics for object-oriented features like classes and inheritance.
Description logics extensions of RDF (Schema) like OIL,
DAML+OIL, and OWL that cannot be fully handled by Horn
logic are provided as modules that interact with a description logic
classiﬁer, e.g. FaCT [25], resulting in a hybrid rule language.

Namespaces and Resources TRIPLE has special support for
namespaces and resource identiﬁers. Namespaces are declared
via clause-like constructs of the form nsabbrev := namespace.,
:= ”http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#”.
e.g.,
Resources are written as nsabbrev:name, where nsabbrev is
a namespace abbreviation and name is the local name of the
resource.

Models RDF models, i.e., sets of statements, are made explicit
in TRIPLE (“ﬁrst class citizens”).1 Statements, molecules, and
also Horn atoms that are true in a speciﬁc model are written
as atom@model
to Flora-2 module syntax), where
atom is a statement, molecule, or Horn atom and model is a
model speciﬁcation (i.e., a resource denoting a model), e.g.:
A[rdf:type → edu:AddSimpleRestriction]@edu:p1. TRIPLE also
allows Skolem functions as model speciﬁcations. Skolem functions
can be used to transform one model (or several models) into a new
one when used in rules (e.g., for ontology mapping/integration):
O[P → Q]@sf(m1, X, Y ) ←− . . ..

Logical Formulae TRIPLE uses the usual set of connectives
and quantiﬁers for building formulae from statements/molecules
and Horn atoms, i.e., ∧, ∨, ¬, ∀, ∃, etc.2 All variables must be
introduced via quantiﬁers, therefore marking them is not necessary
(i.e., TRIPLE does not require variables to start with an uppercase
letter as in Prolog).
Clauses and Blocks A TRIPLE clause is either a fact or a
rule. Rule heads may only contain conjunctions of molecules
and Horn atoms and must not contain (explicitly or implicitly)
any disjunctive or negated expressions.
that a set
of clauses is true in a speciﬁc model, a model block is used:
@model {clauses}, or, in case the model speciﬁcation is param-
eterized: ∀ Mdl @model(Mdl) {clauses}.

To assert

1Note that the notion of model in RDF does not coincide with its
use in (mathematical) logics.
2For TRIPLE programs in plain ASCII syntax, the symbols AND,
OR, NOT, FORALL, EXISTS, <-, ->, etc. are used.
