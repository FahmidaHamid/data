data models, in data storage formats, etc). We propose to annotate
the information of each content source with metadata (using for
example RDF [6]). This metadata will be described by a content
provider speciﬁc ontology (written in OWL [5]). To achieve the
interoperation of different sources, modelled with different ontolo-
gies, we must deﬁne a general, consensual ontology and mapping
rules between this general ontology and each speciﬁc one. A spe-
cial kind of Web Service, that we call Query Server (QS) will store
the ontologies and the mapping information. This service will al-
low semantic translation between general and provider speciﬁc on-
tologies.

Other approaches to use ontologies in integration of heteroge-

neous data sources can be found at [4, 1].

INFOFLEX WORKING MODEL

In this section we will introduce the proposed working model
of our Infoﬂex framework. The main actors involved in the full
process are:

Clients who request information using a speciﬁc query language.
It will be XML

This language has not been deﬁned yet.
based.

Query Servers which translate queries from the model represented
in the general ontology (used by the Client to make his queries)
to the CMS information model.

Content Management Systems (or Content Providers) which store

and manage the requested information.

UDDI repositories where all the Web Services involved on this

scenario are registered.

In ﬁgure 1, we can see the steps which are necessary to obtain

information from one provider. These are:

1. The Query Server registers two Web Service interfaces (one
for clients, other for CMSs access) into an UDDI repository.

2. The CMS access the UDDI looking for the Query Server.

3. The CMS registers its ontology in the Query Server.
