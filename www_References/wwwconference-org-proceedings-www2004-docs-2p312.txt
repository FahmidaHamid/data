1.  Introduction
Enterprise  IT  infrastructures  are  currently  migrating  toward  a
service-oriented  architecture,  using  Web  Services  (WS)  as  a  de-
facto implementation protocol. In spite of the wide acceptance of
WS in computing infrastructures, there have been few studies on
WS characteristics. In this paper, we analyze WS using publicly
available  information  that  we  collected  weekly,  between  August
8th 2003 and January 30th 2004 from a UDDI[3] Business Registry
(UBR). First, we study the evolution of the WS population and its
geographic  distribution.  Second,  we  determine
few
characteristics of public WS, such as the frequency of elementary
types.  Third,  we  develop  a  methodology  for  estimating  WS
message  sizes.  Fourth,  we  examine  the  liveness  and  response
times  of  public  WS.  Lastly,  using  our  methodology,  we  analyze
the Amazon WS site and compare the message sizes predicted by
our  methodology  with
the  message  sizes  observed  during
invocations.
Our initial results contradict common intuition. First, the number
of  public  WS  has  not  increased  dramatically,  although  the
intensity of the standardization and development activities in the
WS  domain  continues  to  be  high.  Second,  the  geographic
distribution  of  public  WS  is  largely  skewed,  with  about  three
fifths  of  public  WS  located  in  USA.  Lastly,  the  sizes  of  WS
response messages and their variation are smaller than that of Web
documents. We expect our results to benefit WS application and
tool  developers,  and  to  improve  our  understanding  of  this
emerging research area. This survey is part of an ongoing research
and detailed analysis results are published on our web site [1].

2.  Population, Distribution, and Structure
Currently,  about  1200  WS  are  registered  in  a  UBR.  Figure  1
summarizes  the  data  collected  during  a  six-month  period.  The

than

number  of  ‘valid’  WS,  i.e.  with  a  retrievable  WSDL  file,  is
substantially  smaller
the  number  of  registered  WS:
approximately 67% of the registrations are not valid. Furthermore,
many of the downloaded WSDL[4] files omit mandatory elements
or contain other syntax errors. During the six month interval, the
number  of  valid  WS  decreases  a  little,  which  is  contrary  to  the
slight increase in the number of registered WS.

Figure  2  (a)  shows  the  geographic  distribution  of  public  WS  on
November 7th 2003. 63% of the WS are hosted in United States.
Figure  2  (b)  shows  the  distribution  of  WS  hosting  sites  on  the
same day. From the fact that the fraction of US sites is smaller, we
can infer that a larger number of US-resident WS are co-hosted.

Figure 3. Frequency of Elementary Types

We  also  analyze  the  WSDL  files  to  determine  the  frequency  of
elementary,  array,  and  compound  types  in  WS  messages.  We

312found  that  responses  use  more  arrays  and  compound  variables
than  requests  do.  Figure  3  shows  the  distribution  of  elementary
types, with array and compound types expanded into elementary
types.  As  most  WS  definitions  do  not  specify  array  lengths,  we
had  to  select  lengths  for  these  arrays.  The  figure  shows  type
distributions for array lengths 2 and 16; in addition, it shows that
the string and string array types are very common.
3.  SOAP Message Size
A  SOAP[4]  message  can  be  divided  into  three  parts  –  HTTP
header, essential tag, and payload. Below is the equation used to
infer the size of a SOAP message:

SOAP  message  size  =  HTTP  header  +  essential  tag  (SOAP
envelope  tag  +  SOAP  body  tag  +  namespaces)  +  payload
(payload  tag  +  summation  of  (type  tag  +  value)  for  each
elementary type field in parameters)


We determine the size of each message component by examining
real  SOAP  messages.  We  investigate  several  messages  and
determine the default size for the HTTP header, essential tag, and
payload  tag.  Next,  we  estimate  the  number  of  elementary  type
fields and determine the average size of the XML representations
for the fields of each type, including type tag.
We compare the distributions of SOAP messages, estimated using
the above equation, to that of existing Web objects (see Figure 4).
For Web objects, we use the model presented in [2], which studies
the population of unique files.

Figure 4. SOAP message vs. Web objects: Array Length is 2
Contrary  to  the  common  expectation  that  SOAP  messages  are
larger  than  current  Web  objects  due  to  XML  formatting,  most
SOAP  messages  are  smaller  than  existing  Web  objects.  For
instance,  while  about  92%  of  SOAP  messages  are  smaller  than
2KB, only 45% of the existing Web objects are smaller than 2KB.

Figure 5. WS and HTTP response delay

We  verify  the  liveness  of  the  valid  WS  sites.  Our  weekly
measurements from two locations, IBM Watson and KAIST, show

that approximately 16% of the valid WS are down and that 2~3%
more  Web  servers  are  alive;  in  addition,  96%  of  the  live  WS
respond in two seconds or less. Figure 5 shows the response time
CDFs for WS as well as for Web servers, as measured on Nov..
13th  2003;  measurements  performed  on  other  dates  show  similar
results.  Our  attempts  to  measure  ping  delays  do  not  show  any
meaningful results, as most sites block ICMP ping messages.

5.  Case Study
Amazon  provides
their  WS  for  associates,  suppliers,  and
developers. The main Amazon WS site is located in US and it is
operated by Amazon itself.  Their  WS  operations  use  only  string
and string array types. HTTP and WS response delays are 327 and
502msec  when  measured  from  IBM  Watson,  and  501  and
510msec from KAIST.
Figure  6  (a)  and  (b)  show  the  message  sizes,  both  real  and
estimated, for requests and responses, respectively. Note that the
browse operations have two kinds of responses – lite and heavy. A
lite response delivers the summary of the selected items, while a
heavy response delivers all the available information. Figure 6 (a)
shows that our estimation of request sizes are accurate. Figure 6
(b) shows that our estimations of response message sizes are less
accurate.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  line  patterns  are
almost  identical  and  that  the  line  for  heavy  response  is  between
the estimated lines.

6.  Conclusion
In this paper, we study several aspects of public WS. Our initial
results  show  that  the  number  of  public  WS  does  not  increase
dramatically  and  that  about  three  fifths  of  the  current  WS
population is based in USA. In addition, our results indicate that
there  are  substantial  differences  between  the  sizes  of  WS
messages and of existing Web objects.
