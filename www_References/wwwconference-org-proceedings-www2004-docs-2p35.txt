 We have created a list of links on our Website to fifteen Websites
which represent Historic Costume Collections. These links extend
the  assets  of  the  online  Collection  to  include  those  of  other
Collections, insinuating community.
7. CONCLUSION
We have implemented a variety of strategies to engage as broad a
community as possible:

•  Developing  a  thesaurus  for  common  language  between

the fashion and historic costume communities

•  Adopting  data  standards  that  expedite  sharing  of  data

across many domains

•  Adopting  image  standards  that  insure  the  best  possible

display of those images

•  Creating online galleries of exhibitions which can be used

as educational tools
Linking  to  other  online  Collections  from  our  website  to
build community

•

These  strategies  have  not  been  without  problems.  By  adopting
collections  quality  image  standards  we  slow  down the digitization
process. We projected two hundred full images sets for phase one of
