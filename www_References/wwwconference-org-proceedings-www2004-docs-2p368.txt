All  participants  were  asked  to  read  the  question  out  loud,  and
click the ‘Start’ button when starting the task. They were asked to
click the ‘Task Track’ button to stop when they found the answer
to  the  question.  These  procedures  were  repeated  until  all  the
questions were completed. The participants were then debriefed.

3.  RESULTS
The mean values of the response variables for the five conditions
were showed in Table 1.
A  repeated  measure  analysis  was  performed,  with  the  five  site
map  conditions  as  a  between-subject  factor,  and  the  three  web
sites as a within-subject factor. Significant main effect was found
for the types of site map and for the three web sites. Significant
interaction  effect  was  also  found  between  the  types  of  site  map
and the three web sites.
Post-hoc analyses showed that participants in the V_NL condition
had a significantly higher rate of finding the correct answers than
those in the H_L and the C condition. It was also found that the
V_NL  condition  required  less  task-completion  time  than  the
H_NL  condition.  In  addition,  the  V_L  condition  visited  fewer
web  pages  than  the  H_NL  condition.  The  V_NL  condition  also
visited  significantly  fewer  web  pages  and  required  fewer  clicks
than the H_NL condition and the C condition.

4.  DISCUSSION
The results confirmed the hypotheses that a visible site map can
enhance performance in an information-searching task [2].
However,  the  results  found  no  significant  effects  of  hyperlinks,
except  for  the  percentage  of  correct  answers,  where  users  were
found  to  perform  better  when  the  site  map  did  not  have
hyperlinks. One possible explanation is that users spent more time
studying  the  site  map  and  understanding  the  organization  of
information on the site when the site map did not have hyperlinks.
This better understanding of the site may improve the chance of
finding the correct answer to the questions.
The  significant  interaction  effects  found  between  the  three  web
sites and the five site map conditions suggested that the positive
benefit of a site map is greater for a larger and more complicated
site. Larger web sites are more likely to be disorienting and a site
map, especially a visible and an immediately accessible one, may
be most helpful in such circumstances.
