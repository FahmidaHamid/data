Figure  2:  (Top)  The  Cluster  Bulls-Eye  View  uses  polar  coordi-
nates to place in close proximity documents with similar rankings
by the different search engines. A document’s radius is a function
of the number of engines that retrieved it and the average of its
different ranking scores. A document’s angle reflects the relative
ratio  of  its  rankings  by  the  different  engines.  (Bottom)  Shows
how all the documents cluster if the engines are assigned different
weights of importance (1, 0.75, 0.5, 1, 0.25) and the radius is now
equal  to  the  weighted  average  of  the  rankings  by  the  different
engines. In both displays, the documents found by at least three
engines  are  selected.  Three  documents  are  highlighted  to  show
how their locations change when the weights are applied.
