Figure 1 Diagrammatic view of simple Scufl workflow
The combination of Scufl, Taverna and Freefluo is being used and
tested  by  an  expanding  community.  Bioinformaticians  have
created workflows that include services developed independently
and  found  on  the  web.  For  example  the  DDBJ-XML  services
(http://xml.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/wsdl/index.jsp)  and  KEGG  services
(http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/soap) from Japan have proved to
be valuable resources. Scufl, Taverna and Freefluo have also been
used,  as  part  of  the  myGrid  project  [2],  in  the  design  and
development  of  a  set  of  sophisticated  workflows  for  researchers
investigating  Graves’  disease,  an  immune  disorder  causing
hyperthyroidism, at the Newcastle Centre for Life.
The Taverna workbench provides a number of different views of a
Scufl  workflow:  an  explorer  view  of  the  model  entities,  a
diagrammatic view (e.g. Figure 1), an XML view, and a view for
providing  inputs  and  starting  workflow  instances.  The  Taverna
workbench also includes an “available services” view. This can be
seen as a view of the web. It is a simple browser of those services,
known to Taverna, whose operations can be added to a model as a
new processor. This “available services” view provides users with
a palette of services when changing a model. It is populated either
from  models  loaded  into  Taverna,  by  introspection  on  a  service
description,  or  by  simple  web  search  and
introspection
(scavenging).  There  is  ongoing  work  into  enhancing  this  simple
“registry”  with  semantic  annotations,  richer  search  facilities  and
hence better guidance during (perhaps semi-automatic) workflow
construction, based on users’ high-level specifications of their in
silico experiments.
