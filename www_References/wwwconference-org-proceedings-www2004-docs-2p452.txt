3. SEMANTIC PROJECTIONS

In information retrieval the effectiveness of a document ranking
system can be assessed by plotting precision versus recall, assum-
ing relevant sets are known. The data collected here allows one to
evaluate how effectively Web pages are ranked based on content or
link similarity by using σs as a surrogate for relevance assessments
and each page as a query (as in “query by example”). Let us deﬁne
linear-projected precision and recall as follows:

X
X
X

P (α, β) =

R(α, β) =

p,q:ασl(p,q)+(1−α)σc(p,q)≥β

|p, q : ασl(p, q) + (1 − α)σc(p, q) ≥ β|

σs(p, q)

σs(p, q)

p,q:ασl(p,q)+(1−α)σc(p,q)≥β

σs(p, q)

p,q

where α is the slope of the projection line and β is the intercept,
which can be used as a ranking parameter.
The projected precision-recall plots in Figure 1 are based on lin-
ear combinations of the form ασl +(1−α)σc. Since most of the σs
“mass” occurs near the origin (σc = σl = 0), recall is visualized
on a log scale. Ranking by link similarity alone (α = 1) produces
better precision at low recall levels, while ranking by content simi-
larity alone (α = 0) produces better precision at high recall levels.
This is consistent with the use of link analysis in ranking by search
engines, since most users only look at a few hits. However, com-
binations of content and link similarity yield better compromise
rankings. In particular, using any amount of content information
in addition to link analysis improves precision at both low recall
levels (where link information alone is noisy) and high recall lev-
els (where link information alone is useless). Thus a search engine
could improve the quality of its results by appropriately combining
query-independent link analysis with content analysis.
