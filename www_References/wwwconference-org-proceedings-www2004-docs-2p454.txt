and averaging graphs), (e)subtracting graphs, (f) selecting
graphs by attributes. The details of these operations are de-
scribed in [6] and the next section. These operations can be
combined in any order, because all of them input and output
a set of subject graphs. Although we deﬁne here only 6 op-
erations, any operation whose inputs and outputs are a set
of subject graphs can be incorporated into the module. The
result visualizer visualizes the operation results by using
the spring model[2]. Users can understand the signiﬁcant
terms and the term-term associations from the visualization
results, and so can grasp the contents of the found texts.

Figure 2 shows the user interface of the system. The user
can invoke text handling operations in diﬀerent orders in-
teractively and intuitively through these windows. 247,489
Web pages in the WT2G test collection1 were used as the
targeted text data. The goal of the user is to discover knowl-
edge such as ’Who is the best relational database vendor?’,
How do users rate the products?’ and ’Are there any com-
petitive products?’. Using the system, the most probable
analysis steps are as follows.

The user inputs the expression ’relational database’ and
invokes (a). The system locates 253 Web pages similar to
it. The user invokes (f) with the condition specifying an an-
chor attribute contains the name of database vendor. The
user discovers that the Oracle site has the most references,
11. The user invokes (d) to make a merged graph (go) to
overview of all the pages referencing the Oracle site, and
(b) to cluster them with similar contents. The system clas-
siﬁes them into 5 categories (7,3,1,1,1). The user invokes
(d) for the pages in each category, (e) to subtract go from
