Figure 1: Architecture of OntoMiner

3. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

The example shown in Figure 2 demonstrates the working
of the OntoMiner algorithm in several phases. The semantic
partitioning algorithm works with single Web page at a time
to extract hierarchy among the labels in the Web page. It
works by ﬁrst ﬂat partitioning the Web page into logical
segments as shown in Figure 2a. Next, it uses dynamic
programming techniques to organize the labels in the Web
page into groups that exploit the structural similarities in
the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. Finally it uses
promotion rules that are based on the presentation and the
format of the Web page to promote the emphasized labels
on top of certain groups. Figure 2b shows the segment of
the DOM tree of the Web page and the ﬁnal hierarchical
tree. OntoMiner employs semantic partitioning algorithm
to obtain hierarchical trees on a collection of Web sites and
