Conference Co-Chair’s Message

We welcome you to New York and WWW2004, the thirteenth conference in the series organized
by  the  International  World  Wide  Web  Conference  Committee.  This  should  be  both  an  exciting
conference and  a very enjoyable experience.  New York is a center of communications, media,
education, finance, and international relations – all areas that are increasingly Web-dependent and
Web-intensive. Attendees and special seminars will reflect those interests.

The  Program  Co-Chairs,  Marc  Najork  and  Craig  Wills,  and  the  superb  international  Program
Committee, have rigorously selected the Refereed Track and Alternate Track papers as well as the
Posters. They have been very selective, and as usual, the quality of papers is very high. You can
find information on all of these contributions on the CD and in the conference series archive. The
technical focus of the world of the Web continues to shift, and this is reflected in the content of
this conference.

We  hope  you  find  the  conference  enjoyable,  the  content  insightful,  and  that  it  helps  move  the
WWW forward and onward.
