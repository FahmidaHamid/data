Conference Co-Chairs’ Message



Welcome  to  Japan  and  WWW2005.   This  is  the  14th  conference  in  the  series  that  was  started  by  Robert
Cailliau in Geneva in 1994.  It is also worth noting that the conference has now been held in each of the
three major W3C host countries (USA, France, and Japan).

This  year’s  conference  maintains  the  traditional  1:3:1  format  including:  a  day  of  tutorial  and  workshop
sessions, three days of keynotes, paper tracks and poster presentations as well as the special W3C track,
and finishes with Developers’ Day.

Once again we are delighted to have Tim Berners-Lee deliver the opening keynote and to be followed by
four internationally distinguished speakers in the other plenary session slots.  This year Developers’ Day
also begins with a special keynote address.

The  resources  and  staff  of  Keio  University,  the  W3C  Japan  Host  and  the  local  Professional  Conference
Organizer have worked with a large number of volunteers and members of the International World Wide
Web  Conference  Committee  (IW3C2),  the  group  that  administer  the  conference  series,  to  organise  this
year’s conference.  This work has been supported by our much valued conference partners and sponsors.

Conferences of this nature happen for three reasons: a spirit of inquiry about the subject; the willingness of
a group of authors write up and share their ideas and research findings; and, a group of organisers (mostly
volunteers) who are prepared to put in the time and effort to build and management a conference program
and run a conference environment.  Conferences are team efforts – our thanks to everyone who has been a
part of the WWW2005 team.

Finally, we hope you find the conference stimulating and professionally rewarding and that you enjoy your
stay in Japan and have a safe trip home.
