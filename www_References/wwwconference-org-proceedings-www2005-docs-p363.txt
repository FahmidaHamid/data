Figure 8: Commonness of candidates among Al-
taVista, AllTheWeb and Google

because the sets of top n candidates for di(cid:11)erent engines
included di(cid:11)erent candidates when n was increased4

The commonness was the lowest in Japanese when the
results were compared between AltaVista and the other two
engines. This was due to the di(cid:11)erent string-based indexing
strategy adopted by AltaVista for Japanese.

Still, the concordance of candidates shown here is sig-
ni(cid:12)cant, even though search engines with totally di(cid:11)erent
methodologies were utilized. This commonness was due to
the totalization process in Kiwi. This leads to a hypothe-
sis: that if su(cid:14)cient data is available, the distribution of the
aggregated search engine results is independent of the cur-
rent ranking methodologies. This holds if all search engines
handle all documents on the Web and Web data is abun-
dant. Of course, this is not the case, in fact, and all search
engines can handle only a portion of the documents on the
Web; therefore, this hypothesis does not hold so trivially.
Even so, we may observe that the data will trend towards
convergence.

Such a hypothesis gives a solid background for what is
being researched in NL and IR based on search engines, in
the sense that the results obtained using a search engine will
be similar even when other search engines are used. Through
our work, we think that we have observed a small piece of
evidence supporting this hypothesis.

8. RELATED WORKS AND DISCUSSION

Studies on usage consultation using the WWW are rather
limited as far as we know. Apart from WebCorp [17], Google
Fight [6], and Google Duel [13], Keller et al. [8] argue that
high-quality n-grams can be derived from the ostensibly
noisy WWW. In the latter case, the target was obtaining
adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams in or-
der to solve the problem of data sparseness in using corpora.
The basic philosophy of using the WWW for obtaining us-
ages is a common thread in our work.

In contrast, if we change the viewpoint from usage to QA,
there are many works, especially those that put emphasis

4If engine A ranks results in the order of r1,r2,r3, whereas
engine B ranks them as r2,r3,r1, then the overlap increases
from 0% to 50% and (cid:12)nally to 100%. Such cases are infre-
quent, however, and B tends to have candidates ranked as
r1,r4,r5.
