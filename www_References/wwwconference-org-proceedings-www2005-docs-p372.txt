APPENDIX
Figure 9 shows the bookFlight—bookHotel pipe. A Rule object is
deﬁned which includes a name, a list of premises, a list of conclu-
sions, and an optional direction. The premise includes triples, that
check the existence of RDF statements in the Jena repository, built-
in user-deﬁned functions (e.g. subtract), and a set of predeﬁned
functions (e.g. makeTemp).

In the sample, a searchHotel_IS eventual event is obtained from
a pair of departureFlightSelected_OS and returnFlightSelected_OS
events. Speciﬁcally, the rule checks the existence of a pair of de-
parture and return events associated to the same passenger, uses a

user-deﬁned function, subtract, to calculate the duration of the stay
at the hotel.

The ﬁnal part of the premise uses the predeﬁned function, make-
Temp, to indicate the creation of two new instances, newEE and
newData, whose properties are assigned in the conclusion of the
rule. The former is an eventualEvent of type searchHotel_IS whose
data property corresponds to an instantiation of hotelBook. The
properties of this instance are in turn obtained from the variables
which have been instantiated in the premise of the rule.
