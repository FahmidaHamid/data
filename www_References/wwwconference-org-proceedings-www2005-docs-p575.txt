7. APPENDIX A: PROOFS

We now look at the two deferred proofs from Section 2.
Recall that Theorem 1 requires the entries of d be non-
negative.

Proof of Theorem 1. P x − x and y = Ax − x + d diﬀer
only in the amount of d added to Ax − x. We can thus write
their diﬀerence as

y − (P x − x) = d − drT x/kdk1 .

(1)

Summing the coordinates of vectors on both sides of (1), and

noting that Pu(P x)u = Pu xu and Pu du = kdk1, gives

yu = kdk1 − rT x .

(2)

Xu

To prove the ﬁrst stated inequality, we move y to the right
hand side of (1), take norms, and use the triangle inequality.

kP x − xk1 ≤ kyk1 + |(kdk1 − rT x)| .

(3)

SubstitutingPu yu for kdk1 −rT x and then |Pu yu| ≤ kyk1,

yu| ≤ 2kyk1 .

(4)

kP x − xk1 ≤ kyk1 + |Xu

Similarly, the second stated inequality results from the

inequalities

kxk1 ≥ rT x = kdk1 −Xu

yu ≥ kdk1 − kyk1 .

(5)

with the inequality kxk1 ≥ rT x following as all |ru| ≤ 1.

The proof of Theorem 2 relies on the assumption that the
coordinates of z lie between zero and the corresponding yu.

Proof of Theorem 2. As each zu lies between zero and
yu, we have that ky − zk1 = kyk1 − kzk1, and starting from
the triangle inequality

ky + Az − zk1 ≤ ky − zk1 + kAzk1

= kyk1 − kzk1 + kAzk1

(6)
(7)

Column u of A sums to ru, and thus kAzk1 ≤ Pu(1−ru)|zu|.

ky + Az − zk1 ≤ kyk1 −Xu

|zu| +Xu

(1 − ru)|zu| (8)

Collecting the summands yields the claimed bound.
