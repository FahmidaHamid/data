Figure 9: Performance and Success Rate vs. QoS
Constraints

til the whole set of skyline services has been examined. In
the latter case, a solution is guaranteed to be found (if one
exists) according to Lemma 1. On the other hand, the suc-
cess rate of the Hybrid method degrades signiﬁcantly as the
diﬃculty of the composition problem increases. The reason
for this behavior is that the Hybrid method decomposes each
of the end-to-end constraints independently, which in such
diﬃcult composition problems may results in a set of local
constraints that cannot be satisﬁed by any candidate.

7. CONCLUSIONS

We have addressed the problem of QoS-based web ser-
vice composition with end-to-end constraints. We identify
the skyline services in terms of their QoS values, and we
use them to improve the eﬃciency of the state-of-the-art
solution. To deal with cases where the size of the skyline
is still large compared to the initial dataset, we select and
use representative skyline services for the composition. We
have also presented an eﬀective method for determining lo-
cal quality levels, which improves the success rate of the
hybrid solution for QoS-based service composition from our
previous work [2]. Finally, we have presented a method for
assisting service providers in improving the competitiveness
of their services to attract potential clients. The results
of the experimental evaluation indicate a signiﬁcant perfor-
mance gain in comparison to existing approaches, which rely
on global optimization.

Our experiments have shown that the performance of our
skyline-based methods is aﬀected by the diﬃculty of the
composition problem, in terms of the number of the speci-
ﬁed end-to-end QoS constraints. In the future work, we plan
to develop a method for estimating the diﬃculty of each
composition problem. This will help to further optimize our
method by deciding from which level of the skyline repre-
sentatives tree (or the QoS levels tree) to start the search in
order to avoid unnecessary iterations.
