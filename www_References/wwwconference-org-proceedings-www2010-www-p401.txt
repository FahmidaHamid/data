beaches, activities,
types of accommodations, and
restaurants make it a great choice for a first visit to the
islands. 1) The beaches! There are so many all over the
island, and all different types: white, black, even red.
Large, busy, and with amenities and activities, or small,
private, and rustic (no facilities). 2) The activities! Go
snorkeling,
fishing,
golfing, hiking up an old volcano, biking down the
volcano, four-wheeling on unpaved, virtually vacant dirt
roads through old lava flows, driving on narrow, curvy,
crowded roads through tropical forests, and helicopter
rides around the island. 3) The restaurants! There are so
many fine-dining choices with all types of menus, as
well as sandwich shops and the more familiar chains.

Lobster,
lobster everywhere, and very reasonably
priced. The city was a GREAT place to find seafood. We
went to a Red Sox game, which was great fun and we
also went to Cape Cod, and Plymouth. This was a highly
recommended vacation that we all enjoyed. Take a
whale watching tour or visit the aquarium and cruise
around the harbor. You can see Old Iron Sides, where
the English lost their tea. We also recommend The Ghost
and Graves tour which was fun, and a way to get a feel
for Boston while getting some local history.
