APPENDIX
A. PROOF OF THEOREM 1

Proof. As deﬁned in Section 2:

C(Xt, Gt) = χ2

t =

(ad − cb)2 · N

(a + b)(c + d)(b + d)(a + c)

where a, b, c, d, N are deﬁned with respect to Xt and PR(t).
Let ˆkr and ˆku be the expected number of agreements among
related and unrelated people respectively in time t + 1. Sim-
ilarly, let ˆmr and ˆmu be the expected number of disagree-
ments among related and unrelated people respectively. The
changes to the contingency table will be as follows:

(vi, vj) ∈ PR(t)
(vi, vj) "∈ PR(t)

t = x ¬(X i

X i

t = X j
ˆkr − ˆmr
ˆku − ˆmu

t = x)

t = X j
−ˆkr + ˆmr
−ˆku + ˆmu

Since there is inﬂuence in the data, the probability of
agreement is higher for related pairs and the probability of
disagreement is higher for unrelated pairs. Thus ˆkr > ˆku
and ˆmr < ˆmu.

Subsequently, the change to the a, d diagonal is positive:

∆ad = (ˆkr − ˆmr) + (−ˆku + ˆmu)
= (ˆkr − ˆku) + ( ˆmu − ˆmr)
> 0

And the change to the b, c diagonal is negative:

∆bc = (ˆku − ˆmu) + (−ˆkr + ˆmr)
= (ˆku − ˆkr) + ( ˆmr − ˆmu)
< 0

However, the net change to N and each marginal is 0
(since k = m, ˆkr + ˆku = k, and ˆmr + ˆmu = m). Let
[ad]! = (a+ˆkr− ˆmr)(d+ ˆmu−ˆku). From above we know that
[ad]! > ad. Similarly let [cb]! = (c + ˆku − ˆmu)(b + ˆmr − ˆkr).
Again, from above we know that [cb]! < cb.
Thus, the autocorrelation will be higher due to inﬂuence:

C(Xt+1, Gt) =

([ad]! − [cb]!)2 · N

(a + b)(c + d)(b + d)(a + c)

> C(Xt, Gt)
