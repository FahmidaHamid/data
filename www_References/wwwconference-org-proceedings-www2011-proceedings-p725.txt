raising the success rate to about 57%, and reducing the path
length from about 24 to about 12.

(3) Adding both interest expansion and lookahead results
in 80% successful routing, with extremely short paths (a
median path length of 7).

(4) Insisting on monotonically better proximity to the
target’s interests typically reduces success rate, but signiﬁ-
cantly improves the length of the path constructed, for each
of the four variations of the algorithm.

(5) Picking the target from a distribution that is restricted
to targets of certain minimum degree dramatically improves
the success rate and path length for decentralized routing
algorithms. While this restriction might appear strange,
this captures the idea the even modestly ‘well-connected’
nodes are signiﬁcantly easier to reach than completely iso-
lated ones. When we place a minimum degree restriction
of 15 (recall that the average degree is only 6.7), the best
algorithm achieves 97% success rate and produces paths al-
most as short as the shortest possible! Even the simplest
of algorithms, Local, succeeds on 50% of the cases — this
reinforces the argument made by Kleinfeld, who, analyz-
ing Milgram’s experiments, suggests that the success of the
routing depends, to some extent, on the fact that the target
was not an isolated person but one well-connected in terms
of geographic location, employment, social status, etc.

(6) Besides the resuls plotted in Figures 3–6, we also ex-
plored the importance of core nodes, and more generally,
the role of weak ties in social routing. Speciﬁcally, we iden-
