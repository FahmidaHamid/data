APPENDIX
A. PROOF OF THEOREM 2

We start by recalling some standard deﬁnitions, as applied
to our setting. Given the prices pj for keywords, an optimal
allocation xij for advertiser i is any solution to the following
linear program:

maximize

Li +

uijxij

subject to

pjxij = Bi

Li +
∀j : xij ≥ 0
Li ≥ 0.

Here xij is the fractional amount of word j assigned to the
advertiser i, and Li is the amount of money unspent by i.
A price vector is called a market equilibrium price vector
if there exist allocations xij that satisfy the following two
conditions:

• At the given price vector, xij is an optimal allocation

for each advertiser i.

• For each keyword j, we have

the supply of each keyword was assumed to be 1).

i xij = 1 (recall that

The next theorem follows from the classical results in the
economic literature (see, for example, Arrow and Debreu[2])
by considering the market with one commodity for each key-
word and an additional commodity termed “money”. The
proof of this theorem is deferred to the full version of the
paper.

the market deﬁned above. Moreover, the market equilibrium
prices are unique, and can be characterized as the set speci-
ﬁed by the following convex program.

Now let us return to the proof of Theorem 2. We show
that as δ and γ approach zero, the constraints in Theorem
3 becomes satisﬁed. In fact, constraints (5), (6), (8), and
(9) are always satisﬁed: constraint (5) is satisﬁed because

no advertiser buys any keyword at a higher price than his
utility, and the other three constraints are satisﬁed because
Algorithm 1 always computes a feasible allocation and non-
negative prices. Therefore, the only constraints that we need
to check are (4) and (7). But it is easy to use Theorem 1
to show that these constraints are satisﬁed approximately,
i.e., there is a value ρ(δ, γ) that approaches zero as δ and γ
approach zero so that:

The prices and allocation of our algorithm must satisfy these
constraints. Consider the convex region speciﬁed by these
relaxed constraints. As δ and γ go to zero, the constraints
approach those of Theorem 3, implying that the price and
utility vectors converge to the unique equilibrium price and
utility vectors, respectively. This completes the proof of
Theorem 2.
