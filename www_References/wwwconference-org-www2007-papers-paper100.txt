6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We evaluated several methods for chemical formula ex-
traction based on SVM and CRF. We also proposed dif-
ferent methods for them to tune the trade-oﬁ between re-
call and precision for imbalanced data. Experiments illus-
trated that CRF is the best regarding eﬁectiveness and ef-
ﬂciency, and SVM linear also has a good performance. Our
trade-oﬁ tuning methods can improve the overall F-measure
scores and increase recall of formulae as expected. Study-
ing diﬁerent subsets of features shows that combining prior
knowledge as advanced features is important to improve the
accuracy. A sequential feature selection algorithm is de-
signed to select frequent and discriminative substructures.
Results show that it can reduce the feature set and the in-
dex size tremendously. Retrieved results of similarity search
with and without feature selection are highly correlated.
We also introduced several query models for chemical for-
mula search, which are diﬁerent from keywords searches in
IR. Corresponding scoring schemes are designed, which ex-
tended the idea of tf-idf, and considered sequential infor-
mation in formulae. Experiment results show that the new
scoring schemes work well.

Several future directions are discussed here. First, user
study is required to evaluate precision and recall of addi-
tional search results. Second, the scoring schemes can be
optimized by global knowledge learned from users’ click-
through information. We can expect non-formula strings
among extracted formulae can get a lower rank and can be
identiﬂed easily. Third, when we analyze the structures of
chemical formulae, which occurrence of a string pattern is a
meaningful substructure? This is a challenging issue since
formulae may not have enough information and how to de-
ﬂne a substructure is a problem. Furthermore, which sub-
structures are useful to measure the similarity? Finally, the
identity ambiguity exists for formulae, since even though we
have a unique id for each object in a database, id matching
of each appearance is a challenging issue.
