combination of the blocks it has (shown in the ﬁgure as 1 ⊕ 2) to
node B, which can then be used with node C. Note that without a
knowledge of the block transfers in other parts of the network, it’s
not easy for node B to determine the right block to download. But
with network coding, this task becomes trivial.

We now detail how network coding can be used in a P2P system.
In Figure 9, the ﬁle exists initially only at the server. When node A
c1, c2,··· , cn, and generates E1 = Pn
contacts the server, the server combines all the blocks of the ﬁle to
create an encoded block E1. The server picks random coefﬁcients
i=1 ci.bi, where bi repre-
sents a block. The server then sends node A, E1 and the coefﬁcient
vector −→c = (ci). Note that all the coefﬁcients are chosen from
and the operations done in a ﬁnite ﬁeld 1 When node A sends a
block to node B, A similarly combines the already encoded blocks
it has (namely E1 and E2) and sends node B, the encoded block
−→
0
.
E3 = c“
c
2.
With network coding, any block that a node receives is useful with
very high probability. The downside of network coding is that a
node often has to wait until it downloads the whole ﬁle before it
can start decoding the blocks.

APPENDIX
In this section, we give a short description of the beneﬁts and the
mechanics of network coding. We illustrate the beneﬁts of network
coding with a simple example (Figure 8). Assume that node A has
already received blocks 1 and 2. Without a scheduler having global
knowledge, node B will download block 1 or 2 with equal proba-
bility. Simultaneously, let’s say node C independently downloads
block 1. If node B were to download block 1, the link between B
and C would be rendered useless.

Figure 8: This example shows the beneﬁts of network coding when
nodes only have local knowledge.

1If the ﬁnite ﬁeld is small in size, there could be “collisions” where
two nodes pick the same set of coefﬁcients, thereby degrading the
performance [20]. Typically, ﬁeld sizes of 216 provide enough di-
versity.
