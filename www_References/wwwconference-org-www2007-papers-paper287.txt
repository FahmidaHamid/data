Figure 14. Prototype device with compass/tilt sensor.

The device consists of a custom-built plastic shell that snaps onto
the back of a standard mass-market mobile phone. Mounted inside
the  shell  is  an  integrated  digital  compass/tilt  sensor  module
purchased  from  a  commercial  vendor.  The  module  has  a
standalone  power  supply  and  communicates  with  the  mobile
phone  over  a  Bluetooth  connection.  We  developed
three
alternative  proof-of-concept  user  interfaces  for  the  Wikipedia
Finder  application,  which  we  tested  on  the  prototype:  A  basic
Smart Compass and a Geo-Wand, as described in Section 2, and a
“panorama GUI”: The Smart Compass GUI consists of a circular
compass  rose  with  small  arrows  that  indicate  nearby  Wikipedia
articles. The GUI is rotated dynamically in response to the user’s
physical orientation, based on the input from the digital compass.
The Geo-Wand is used like a scanning device: The user interface
indicates  visible  Wikipedia  article  locations  while  the  user  pans
the  device  slowly  across  the  environment.  The  panorama  GUI,
finally,  shows  locations  of  nearby  Wikipedia  articles  in  a
horizontally scrolling 360-degrees-billboard view. Screenshots of
the Smart Compass and the panorama GUIs are shown in Figure
15.

7.  SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
In  this  paper  we  discussed  how  sensors  included  with  future
mobile  phones  can  enable
types  of  geospatial
applications and user interfaces. We identified the need for new
APIs  to  geospatial  data  on  the  Web  and  presented  the  Local
Visibility  Model  (LVis)  as  our  candidate  for  an  XML  data
exchange format for local geographical information. We showed
how the LVis can function as a unified data model that enables a
variety of different interaction styles. By retaining the geometric
arrangement  of  the  geospatial  search  result  and  encoding  a
simplified  ‘billboard’  description  of  the  search  space  geometry,
