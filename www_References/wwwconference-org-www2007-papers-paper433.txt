ules and the Y-axis the number of modules whose size is within the
given range. The plots thus give an idea of the distribution for the
sizes of the different modules.

For SNOMED, NCI and GALEN-Small, we can observe that the
size of the modules follows a smooth distribution. In contrast, for
GALEN-Full, we have obtained a large number of small modules
and a signiﬁcant number of very big ones, but no medium-sized
modules in-between. This abrupt distribution indicates the pres-
ence of a big cycle of dependencies in the ontology, which involves
all the concepts with large modules. The presence of this cycle
can be spotted more clearly in Figure 3(f); the ﬁgure shows that
there is a large number of modules of size in between 6515 and
6535 concepts. This cycle does not occur in the simpliﬁed version
of GALEN and thus we have the smooth distribution for that case.
In contrast, in Figure 3(e) we can see that the distribution for the
“small” modules in GALEN-Full is smooth and much more similar
to the one for the simpliﬁed version of GALEN.

In order to explore the use of our results for ontology design and
analysis, we have integrated our algorithm for extracting modules
in the ontology editor SWOOP [9]. The user interface of SWOOP
allows for the selection of an input signature and the retrieval of the
corresponding module.

As an illustration, consider in Figure 4 the locality-based mod-
ule for the atomic concept DNA Structure in the NCI ontology, as
obtained in SWOOP. Recall that, according to Case 2 of Propo-
sition 9, the locality-based module Oloc{A} for every atomic con-
cept A ∈ Sig(O) contains all necessary axioms for, at least, all
the (entailed) super-concepts of A in O. Thus Oloc{A} can be seen
as the “upper ontology” for A.
In fact, Figure 4 shows that the
locality-based module for DNA Structure contains only the con-
cepts in the “path” from DNA Structure to the top level concept
Anatomy Kind. This suggests that the knowledge in NCI about
the particular concept DNA Structure is very shallow in the sense
that NCI only “knows” that a DNA Structure is a macromolecular
structure, etc. which, in the end, is an anatomic structure.
