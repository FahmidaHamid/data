4. RELATED WORK

The subject of the use of passwords, and alternatives, for
authentication has been analyzed at length in the computer
security literature. However, web users’ password habits
have received far less attention. An early study of users’
password habits on a UNIX time sharing system is [12].
Morris and Thompson examined various attacks on pass-
word systems, and compile a study of 3289 passwords gath-
ered from many users. They found that 86% of the pass-
words were extremely weak: being too short, containing
lowercase letters only, digits only or a combination of the
two, or being easily found in dictionaries or lists of names.
The results we present in Section 3.3 in some sense update
and extend this work with much more data. While much
has changed since 1979 (e.g. a minimum of 6 characters is
very common) it is just as true that many users appear to
choose the weakest possible password, unless forced to do
otherwise.

An experiment by Grampp and Morris [6] found that weak
passwords, such as names followed by a single digit, were in
widespread use in a number of machines they examined in
a corporate network. Klein [5] reported being able to crack
about 25% of passwords in use, again on a Unix system,
by brute force attack. Adams and Sasse [3] surveyed users
about password memorability, and also conclude that choos-
ing secure passwords that are memorable is proving a diﬃ-
cult task for many users. Our ﬁndings on password strength
reinforce and extend these reports.

Yan et al.

[9] performed a more recent study of pass-
word memorability and security. The survey involved 288
students; a third were asked to choose a password (given
certain password rules), a third were assigned random pass-
words, and a third were asked to choose a password using a
mnemonic based on a phrase. Among their ﬁndings were
that the randomly assigned and phrase based passwords
were similarly to crack by dictionary attacks, but the phrase
based passwords were signiﬁcantly easier to remember.

There have been numerous surveys of user password
habits that employ questionnaires. A good synopsis of re-
cent surveys is [2]. This is a very useful compendium of user
responses on questions of their password use, re-use, and
forgetting habits as well as a source of password policies at
major institutions. Most of the data in [2] is obtained by
surveying users. By contrast our study measures what they
actually do, rather what they say they do. Further, at 544k
participants, we have more than 100 times more data than
most of the existing surveys.

5. CONCLUSION

The data allows us to measure for the ﬁrst time aver-
age password habits for a large population of web users.
Many facts previously suspected, can be conﬁrmed using
large scale measurements rather than anecdotal experience
or relatively small user surveys. The results particularly con-
ﬁrm the conventional wisdom about the large number and
poor quality of user passwords. In addition passwords are
re-used and forgotten a great deal. We are able to estimate
the number of accounts that users maintain, the number of
passwords they type per day, and the percent of phishing
victims in the overall population.
