Table 3. Matrix of designer expectation and best representation from experiments, for each of 13 health symptoms. Where designer
expected ‘dynamic’ representation to be better, we count a match with animation and video; where ‘static’ is marked, matches
with  photo  and  static.  Matches  of  experiment  with  designer  expectation  are  in  bold  face.  Matches  occur at  60%  --  better  than
chance, but not good enough that designer intuition can be relied upon.

Notes



Static representation of vomit was

considered good enough by designers.
Dynamic information expected to be

important.

Generally difficult to interpret. (Noise

effects)



Animation quality very important.




Easy to understand regardless of
representation. (Noise effects)
Some confusion as to meaning of

symptom.




Surprising value of dynamic effects.
