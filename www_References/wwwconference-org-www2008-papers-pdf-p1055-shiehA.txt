Figure 2. In the left hand side, users see a semantic graph with its center node as the search keyword: solar energy. Whenever
the user mouse over a node, its Google Image search results are displayed on the right. The radii of terms from center
represent how many semantic degrees away from the search term. The thickness of links represents the weights of
relatedness. The importance of each correlated terms relative to the keyword also be ranked on the upper-right.
