where C(H) is the cluster that host H belongs to, and spamicity(h)
is the predicted spamicity of h with preliminary detection. With
different f(n) and K, we can get several clustering features. Here
we chose K = 1000, f(n) ∈{1,  n,  log(n)}. 3 clustering features are
extracted.
2.2.2  Propagation Features
Propagation features is computed as follows:

where  t  is  the  iterative  times,  pf(h)(0)  =  spamicity(h),  and
weight(h,H) is the weight of host h and H. The graph can be the
forward graph, the backward graph or the bidirectional graph.
In  the  experiments,  weight(h,H)  ∈{1,  n,  log(n)},  where  n  is  the
number  of  links  between  h  and  H,  t  =  5,  and  all  the  above
mentioned graphs are used. 9 propagation features are extracted.
2.2.3  Neighbor Features
The  neighborhood  is  a  strong  indicator  about  that  host  with
respect to it being spam or non-spam. Neighbor features (nf) can
be computed as
Hnf

               (3)
in which N(H) represents the neighbor relation set of host H, N(H)
∈{inlink(H),  outlink(H),  outlink(outlink(H)),  inlink(inlink(H)),
inlink(outlink(H)),  outlink(inlink(H))},  inlink(H)  represents  the
inlink set of H, and outlink(H) is the outlink set of H.
In  the  following  experiments,  for  inlink(H)  and  outlink(H),
weight(H, h)  ∈{1, log(n)} and for all the  rest  neighbor  relation,
weight(H, h) = 1. Total 8 neighbor features are extracted.
2.3  Detection Algorithm
The detection algorithm we used in the experiment is bagging, a
famous meta-learning algorithm. The weak classifier for bagging
is C4.5.
3.  EXPERIMENTS
3.1  Data Collection
WEBSPAM-UK2006  [4]  is  used  in  our  experiments.  The
collection includes 77.9 million pages, corresponding to roughly
11400 hosts. We use all the labeled data with their home page in
