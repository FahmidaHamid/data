4.  RAP DETECTING ALGORITHM
The main idea of the RAP detecting algorithm is to differentiate
the  connection  categories  using  sequential  hypothesis  testing
based on analytic model of WLAN’s STJ and the prior probability
distribution  (PPD)  of  the  Ethernet’s.  The  PPD  can  be  achieved
from  the  captured  trace.  Accordingly,  the  PPD  and  CDF  of  STJ
WLAN can be calculated from formula (2). Then, STJ of all TCP
connections  can  be  measured  online  and  be  leveraged  to
differentiate
type  of  connection.  The  RAPs  can  be
determinated  by  checking  the  IP  addresses  of  these  detected
wireless connections. The detailed illumination of the algorithm is
abbreviated.

5.  EXPERIMENT RESULT
We  implement  the  algorithm  and  install  the  measurement  probe
into the 100Mbps Ethernet access link of a campus network with a
splitter,  where  users  access  Internet  with  Ethernet  or  802.11b/g.
The  experiment  results  of  STJ-based  approach  and  Ack-Pairs[2]
are  compared  as  Table  1.  There  is  no  detecting  error  with  STJ-
based approach. From Table 1, the detecting performance metrics
such  as  the  detecting  ratio,  average  detecting  time  and  packets
required  in  our  approach  are  all  better  than  Ack-Pairs  based
approach.
We  also  check  the  effect  of  NAT  with  our  approach  with
experiment  on  the  operated  network  and  the  data  are  shown  as
Figure 3. The CDF of wireless STJ with NAT is near to that of
