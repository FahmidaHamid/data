PANEL SUMMARY or OVERVIEW
Rich media data, such as video, imagery, music, and gaming, do no longer play just a
supporting role on the World Wide Web to text data.  Thanks to Web 2.0, rich media is
the primary content on sites such as Flickr, PicasaWeb, YouTube, and QQ.  Because of
massive  user  generated  content,  the  volume  of  rich  media  being  transmitted  on  the
Internet  has  surpassed  that  of  text.  It  is  vital  to  properly  manage  these  data  to  ensure
efficient bandwidth utilization, to support effective indexing and search, and to safeguard
copyrights (just to name a few).  This panel invites both researchers and practitioners to
discuss the challenges of Web-scale media-data management. In particular, the panelists
will address issues such as leveraging Rich Media and Web 2.0, indexing, search, and
scalability
