A. PROOF OF THEOREM 3.2

n + ε.

Proof. We prove that claim holds even if the advertis-
ers have large demands. We deﬁne a special case of selling
banner advertisements . Consider m sets A1,··· , Am, each
of size k; let A = ∪m
i=1Ai and n = |A|. Also consider a set
Q of size q which is disjoint from A. Also, assume k = O(q)
and kq = o(√n).
Problem B(k, q, n) is deﬁned with m advertisers. Let c =
2(1 − p q
n + ε). Let the bid of advertiser i, (Ii, di, bi), be
equal to (Q ∪ Ai, ck, 1). We show that it is NP-Hard to
approximate B(k, q, n) within a ratio of 2p q
Consider the k−uniform regular set cover instances de-
ﬁned in the proposition 3.1, for ε and s0 = 3. We say an
instance is of type YES if all elements can be covered by
t disjoint sets. An instance is of type NO if every s ≤ s0t
t )s + ε of the ele-
sets cover at most a fraction of 1 − (1 − 1
ments. We show if an algorithm can approximate problem
B(k, q, n) within a ratio of 2p q
n + ε, then this algorithm can

distinguishes between YES and NO instances.

For the YES instances, there are t = n

k disjoint set which
cover all the n elements. Hence, the value in this case is at
least t(k − (kc − k)) = n(2 − c).
For a NO instance, any s sets, 0 ≤ s ≤ s0t, cover at most
t )s +ε)n elements. Therefore, the value of any s
q +(1−(1− 1
t )s +ε)n)−csk. Note that t can
sets is at most 2(q+(1−(1− 1
be made arbitrary large ([14]); hence, we can approximate
(1 − 1
t with arbitrary accuracy. Thus, the value
of any s sets is at most:

t ) with e

We ﬁnd the optimum value for s by the ﬁrst order condi-

tions:

choice of m ≥ s0t sets is negative, because the total demand
is more than double of the number of elements. Therefore,
the ratio between the value from a NO instance and a Yes
instance is at most:

B. FINDING A LOWER BOUND ON γ

Here, we compute a lower bound on the value of γ deﬁned
(α+1)si−α with respect to

in (8). Taking the derivative of 2si−1−ln 2si
si:

(2 − 1/si)((α + 1)si − α) − (2si − 1 − ln 2si)(α + 1)

((α + 1)si − α)2

α/si − 2α + (α + 1) ln 2si

=

(12)

((α + 1)si − α)2

Deﬁne fα(x) = α/x − 2α + (α + 1) ln 2x, x ∈ (0, 1]. The
ﬁrst and the second derivative of fα with respect to x are:

α + 1

d fα
d x
d fα
d2 x

α
x2 +
= −
2α
=
x3 −

x
α + 1

x2

Hence, for α > 1 and x ∈ (0, 1], function fα is strictly
α+1 . Therefore, fα is

convex and takes its minimum at x = α
increasing in [ α

α+1 , 1].

If fα(1) = ln 2 − (1 − ln 2)α ≤ 0, then fα is negative in
[ α
α+1 , 1]. Hence, (12) is decreasing in [ α
α+1 , 1], and take its
minimum at 1. For α ≥ ln 2
1−ln 2 , fα(1) ≤ 0. Plugging in (8),
γ = 2−1−ln 2
(α+1)si−α = 1− ln 2. Therefore, for this range of α, the
approximation ratio is 1−ln 2
2−ln 2 .

For 1 < α < ln 2

1−ln 2 , as we prove later, fα( α

α+1 ) is negative.
Because fα(1) is positive, by the intermediate value theorem,
there exists a point x∗ in [ α
α+1 , 1] for which fα is zero. This
point is the root of equation:

fα(x) = α/x − 2α + (α + 1) ln 2x = 0.

Because fα is increasing in [ α

α+1 , 1], by convexity, x∗ gives
the minimum value of (12). Plugging this value for γ into
γ
1+γ , we get (5) as a lower bound on the approximation ratio
of 1 < α < ln 2

1−ln 2 .

Now we only need to show that for α > 1, fα( α

negative. For x = 1
fα is strictly convex and takes its minimum at
Therefore, fα( α

α+1 ) is
2 ) = 2α−2α+(α+1) ln 1 = 0. Also,
α+1 > 1

α+1 ) < 0.
