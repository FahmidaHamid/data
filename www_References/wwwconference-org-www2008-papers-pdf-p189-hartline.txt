APPENDIX
A. PROOFS
Proof of Lemma 2.1.

Proof. Fix an ordering σ of the elements of the set S.

We can write f (S) as the sum 1≤i≤|S| f (Si) − f (Si−1).

Here Si consists of the ﬁrst i elements of the set S and we
assume that f (S0) = 0.

Recall the deﬁnition of the set S

from the lemma state-

(cid:5)

ment. Using linearity of expectations, we have that:

(cid:5)

E[f (S

i) − f (S
(cid:5)

(cid:5)
i−1)]

f (S

p · (f (Si) − f (Si−1))

1≤i≤|S(cid:4)|

)] = E[ (cid:4)
≥ (cid:4)
1≤i≤|S|
= p · f (S)

The second inequality uses the submodularity of f .

Proof of Lemma 3.2.

Proof. We show how to reduce any instance of the NP-
Hard maximum feedback arc set problem [4, 8, 14] to our
problem. This establishes that our problem is also NP-Hard
and we cannot achieve a polynomial time solution to our
problem unless P = N P .

In an instance of the maximum feedback arc set problem,
given an edge-weighted directed graph, we need to order the
nodes of the graph to maximize the total weight of edges

going in the backward direction in the ordering. We now
describe the reduction.

Let the nodes of the graph be the set of buyers. The
edge weights are the weights wij. Let wij equal 0 for edges
absent. We now deﬁne the pricing. Given the ordering in
which to oﬀer buyers, we oﬀer prices equal to the player’s
value; for a player i it is j∈S∪{i} wji, where S is the set
of nodes visited before i. Given any ordering σ, the revenue
from such pricing is equal to the weight of the feedback arc
set when the nodes in the graph are ordered in the reverse
of σ. Thus ﬁnding the the optimal marketing strategy is
equivalent to computing the maximum feedback arc-set.

The above proof shows the importance of constructing the
right oﬀer sequence; we now observe that even in settings in
which the inﬂuence is bidirectional, but the buyer has incom-
plete information, the oﬀer sequence matters. For example,
consider the additive model corresponding to a star graph
of n buyers. Suppose that wii is 0, wij, j (cid:10)= i is 0 if neither
i or j is the center; and wij is drawn from the uniform dis-
tribution on the interval [0, 1] otherwise. We ﬁnd that the
optimal marketing strategy starts at the center and oﬀers
it a carefully calculated price; then it oﬀers the remaining
buyers the optimal (myopic) price. Somewhat suprisingly,
if, instead, we had complete information, the oﬀer sequence
does not matter. The example shows that incomplete infor-
mation makes the oﬀer sequence important.

Lemma A.1. [3] A buyer, whose value is distributed ac-
cording to a distribution that satisﬁes the monotone hazard
rate condition, accepts an oﬀer price equal to the mean value
with probability at least 1/e.

x

Proof. Fix the set S of buyers who already own the
item and the buyer under consideration, i. Let f and F
be the density and distribution functions for the buyer’s
value vi(S). By Deﬁnition 2, we can write log(1 − F (x)) =
a h(t)dt. As h(t) is non-decreasing in t, log(1 − F (x))
−
(cid:9)
is concave. Now, using Jensens inequality, log(1 − F (μ)) ≥
log(1− F (x))dF (x) = (cid:9)
0 log(1− y)dy ≥ −1. (Replacing
∞
(cid:9)
0
F (x) by y.) Taking the exponent on both sides completes
the proof.

Proof of Lemma 5.4.

Proof. Because the function h is strictly increasing, the

inverse function h

−1 is deﬁned. So for all t,
fh(t)
1 − Fh(t)

1 − F (h−1(t))

−1(t))

f (h

=

Thus the monotone hazard rate condition is satisﬁed for
˜h(a) if and only if for all t and e > 0,
1−F (h−1(t+e)) . But this is true as the random

the random variable
f (h−1(t))
1−F (h−1(t))
variable a satisﬁes the monotone hazard rate condition.
