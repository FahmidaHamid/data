APPENDIX
A. PROOF OF THEOREM 1

First, we show that there exists a recommendation that
satisﬁes any proper subset of the axioms. In the following
cases, we consider a voting network G = (N, V+, V−, E) and
source s ∈ N .
1. System without symmetry. Consider the trivial rec-
ommendation system that always recommends +. This sys-
tem trivially satisﬁes the remaining axioms.
2. System without positive response. Consider the

206WWW 2008 / Refereed Track: Internet Monetization - Recommendation & SecurityBeijing, Chinatrivial recommendation system that always recommends 0.
This system trivially satisﬁes the remaining axioms. (Recall
that axiom 4, neighborhood consensus, refers only to distinct
non-voters.)
3. System without neighborhood-consensus. Con-
sider the recommendation system which assigns to each non-
voter u the recommendation equal to sgn(a − b) where a is
the number of edges from u to positive voters and b is the
number of edges to negative voters. It is symmetric, neu-
tral, and obeys positive response. It obeys IIS since imme-
diate neighbors of s are reachable and can not be removed.
Transitivity is implied by the fact that this “local majority”
system simply counts the number of edges leading to a set of
nodes; since the number of edges connecting to X ⊆ Succ(s)
is ﬁxed, it obeys transitivity.
4. A System Without IIS. In order to design a rec-
ommendation system that satisﬁes all axioms except IIS,
deﬁne S+ to be the set of nodes u ∈ N that have at least
one outgoing neighbor, and all of whose outgoing neighbors
are in V+ and have no neighbors other than u. (These are
essentially the nodes described in the consensus axiom, ex-
cept that it applies to voters as well, e.g., S+ ∩ V− is not
necessarily empty.) Similarly deﬁne S−. For any nonvoter
s ∈ V , the recommendation to s is + if s ∈ S+, − if s ∈ S−.
For all of the remaining nonvoters, the recommendation is
sgn(|S+ ∪ V+| − |S− ∪ V−|).

It is easy to see that this recommendation system satisﬁes
symmetry. The positive response axiom follows from the fact
that the recommendation 0 for s can be generated only when
|S+ ∪ V+| = |S− ∪ V−|. Adding a new positive voting node
w that is pointed to by only s must increase |S+ ∪ V+| and
cannot increase |S−∪V−|, since s (cid:9)∈ S−∪S+∪V−∪V+. To see
that the system satisﬁes neighborhood consensus, note that
moving a nonvoter from S+ to V+ doesn’t change any the
sets in any other way. Finally, to see that the system satisﬁes
transitivity, consider disjoint A, B, C ⊆ N and s ∈ N such
that s trusts A more than B and B more than C. Note that
S+ depends only on V+ and is independent of V−. Also note
that switching the sign of the votes switches the sets S+ and
S− due to the symmetry of the algorithm.
Next consider two cases. In case 1, suppose that s ∈ S+
when V+ = A. This means that s will receive a positive
recommendation when V− = C so s trusts A more than C.
In case 2, s (cid:9)∈ S+ when V+ = A. Since s trusts A more
than B and B more than C, this means in particular that
s (cid:9)∈ S+ when V+ = B nor when V+ = C (and s (cid:9)∈ S−
when V− = B or V− = C). Hence, in all cases, s’s vote
will equal sgn(|S+ ∪ V+| − |S− ∪ V−|). Thus |S+ ∪ V+| is
a measure of trust of s in a set V+, and hence the system
obeys transitivity.
5. A System Without Transitivity. Theorem 2 implies
that RW, the random walk recommendation system, satisﬁes
axioms 1-4.
6. Inconsistency Now we prove that there is no recom-
mendation system satisfying axioms 1-5. Consider the graph
(V, E) depicted in Figure 3(i). We claim that s trusts A more
than B and s trusts B more than C, but s does not trust A
more than C. This will prove impossibility.

To see that s trusts A more than B, consider the voting
network G = (V, A, B, E). By the IIS axiom, we can ignore
the edges from B to C without changing the recommenda-
tion to s, to get voting network G(cid:3)
. Next imagine removing
one of the nodes in A (and its associated edge) to get voting

. Since G(cid:3)(cid:3)

network G(cid:3)(cid:3)
is a star graph with three + votes,
three − votes, and 2 nonvoters aside from s, the recommen-
dation for s has to be 0 by the symmetry axiom. By positive
response, therefore, the recommendation for s in G(cid:3)
has to
be + and hence s trusts A more than B.

To see that s trusts B more than C, consider the voting
network G = (V, B, C, E). Again by the IIS axiom, we can
ignore the edges from B to C without changing the recom-
mendation to s. We are now again in a star graph with 3 +
votes, 2 − votes, and 4 0 votes. By symmetry and positive
response, as above, the recommendation to s must be +,
which is what we needed.

Finally, to see that s does not trust A more than C, con-
sider the voting network G = (V, A, C, E). By three appli-
cations of neighborhood consensus we can take the votes of
B to be all −. By IIS we can transform the graph yet again
into a star graph, this time with 5 − votes and 4 + votes.
As reasoned above, the recommendation to s must be −,
and hence s does not trust A more than C.

B. PROOF OF THEOREM 2

We ﬁrst apply a sequence of transformations to the graph,
to get the graph to a point in which all edges lead to vot-
ers or sink nonvoters. Each of these transformations can be
shown, by the axioms, not to change any recommendations.
Moreover, none of these transformations change the recom-
mendations computed by RW. Hence, it suﬃces to show the
theorem for the case where all edges point to voters or sink
nonvoters.

The transformation removes all edges pointing to any sin-
gle nonvoter (that is not a sink), as follows. Take a node
v which is a nonvoter but has out-degree k > 0. Take any
other node u that points to v (cid:4) > 0 times. We will ap-
ply trust propagation to remove these edges to v, without
adding other edges to v. To do this, we apply (cid:4)-fold edge du-
plication (scale invariance) to v and k-fold edge duplication
(scale invariance) to u without changing any recommenda-
tions. This makes the number of edges from u to v equal
to (cid:4)k and the out-degree of v also equal to (cid:4)k. Hence, we
can apply trust propagation to remove all edges from u to
v. This can be applied in turn to each node that points
to v, to get a graph where all edges point to voters or sink
nonvoters.

Note that each of these transformations does not change
the recommendations of the RW system, either. The reason
is that RW obeys scale invariance and trust propagation,
which can be seen easily from the random walk deﬁnition.
When the random walk reaches a non-sink nonvoter, it con-
tinues on a random edge out of that nonvoter. The trust
propagation simply provides a “shortcut” which exactly sim-
ulates two steps of the random walk at this point.

So, without loss of generality, it suﬃces to show the RW
system is correct for a graph with only edges pointing to vot-
ers and sink nonvoters. Consider any source s and the sub-
graph reachable from that source via directed edges through
nonvoters. If no voter had multiple edges pointing to it, then
the theorem would follow from positive response and sym-
metry. The reason is that when there were an equal number
of + and − voters, by symmetry the recommendation of s
would have to be 0, regardless of the structure of edges to
nonvoter sinks. By positive response, adding any number of
edges from s to more new + voters would cause the recom-
mendation of s to become positive (similarly for − voters).

207WWW 2008 / Refereed Track: Internet Monetization - Recommendation & SecurityBeijing, ChinaThe case that remains is where there are multiple parallel
edges to voters. Say we have a +-voter v with k incoming
edges (and, without loss of generality, no outgoing edges).
By neighborhood consensus, we can change such a voter to
a nonvoter and add a number of outgoing edges to k new,
distinct + voters that have no other neighbors. Now we can
apply trust propagation to v to get a new graph where all
edges pointing to v have been replaced by edges pointing
directly to new nonvoters, without changing recommenda-
tions or the behavior of RW. In addition, we can remove
v without changing s’s recommendation, since there is no
path from s to v. We can apply this procedure to each +
and − voter with more than one incoming edge, until all
voters have in-degree 1. The result for this case then follows
from the argument in the above paragraph.

C. PROOF OF THEOREM 3

Without loss of generality, we assume there are no edges
between pairs of voters. Part (a) follows trivially from the
majority axiom and the fact that any directed acyclic graph
can be partitioned into levels, where each edge is from a
node in a higher level to a node in a lower level.

For Theorem 4(b), we ﬁrst state an interesting property

of the min-cut system.

Lemma 1. Let G = (N, V+, V−, E) be a voting network
and R(G) be the recommendations of the min-cut system.
Let C the multiset of edges between nodes in R+(G) and
nodes in V− ∪ R−(G)∪ R0(G) plus with those between nodes
in R−(G) ∪ R0(G) and nodes in V+. Then C is a min-cut.

Note that this lemma is asymmetric, we have essentially put
all 0 recommendations with the negative recommendations.

Proof. Given cuts C and C(cid:3)

, and their corresponding node sets C+ and C(cid:3)

deﬁne the max of the two
min-cuts as follows. For any cut C, let the node-set C+ be
the set consisting of +-voters and also nonvoters that can
reach any + voter after C has been removed. Given min-cuts
C and C(cid:3)
+, the
max of the two min-cuts is deﬁned to be the cut that cuts
any edges between nodes in C+ ∩ C(cid:3)
+).
(Note that the node-set corresponding to the max of the
two cuts is simply C+ ∩ C(cid:3)
+.) By repeated application of
this observation, we get the lemma, because the intersection
of all node-sets corresponding to min-cuts gives exactly the
cut described by the lemma.

+ and N \ (C+ ∩ C(cid:3)

It remains to show that the max of C and C(cid:3)

is a min-cut
by itself. To do this, it is helpful to deﬁne the min of two
min-cuts, which is the completely symmetric notion to the
max. Let the max be A and the min be B. It is not hard to
, where (cid:10) denotes multiset
see that multisets A(cid:10) B ⊆ C (cid:10) C(cid:3)
union. The reason is that the number of times a given edge
is cut by C and C(cid:3)
(0, 1, or 2) is at least as great as the
number of times it is cut by A and B (those edges between
C+ \ C(cid:3)
+ \ C+ are not cut at all by A or B). Thus
|A| +|B| ≤ |C| +|C(cid:3)|. Furthermore, A and B are both cuts.
Hence, at least one of them, say A, must no larger than C
, which have the same size. But |A| = |C| = |C(cid:3)|
and C(cid:3)
are min-cuts. Hence, |B| = |A| and they are
since C and C(cid:3)
all min-cuts.

+ and C(cid:3)

We ﬁrst argue that the min-cut system satisﬁes the group-
think axiom. Consider ﬁrst part (a) of groupthink. Suppose

S ⊆ R+(G) is a subset of the nonvoters that are all given
positive recommendations. These nodes are all connected to
positive voters in every min-cut. Take the min-cut deﬁned
in the above lemma. Now, for the purposes of contradiction,
suppose S does not have a majority of positive edges leav-
ing it. Then we claim that we could ﬁnd another min-cut
C(cid:3)
in which no node in S is connected to a + voter, which
violates the deﬁnition of the min-cut system. In particular,
we would take C(cid:3)
to be the cut which is equal to C, except
that it also cuts all positive edges leaving S and does not
cut any negative or neutral edges leaving S. This is a cut
because C was a cut and no new paths between positive and
negative voters have been created – they would have to go
through S but S has no positive edges and thus is discon-
nected from the positive voters. Furthermore, C(cid:3)
would not
be larger than C because we have assumed that S does not
have a majority of positive edges leaving it. Hence, we have
a min-cut and the desired contradiction. The argument for
the case where S all has negative recommendations follows
by symmetry of the system.

We next argue that the min-cut system satisﬁes Group-
think (b). For the purposes of contradiction, suppose we
have a set S ⊆ R−(G) ∪ R0(G) such that S has a ma-
(The other case, where
jority of positive outgoing edges.
S ⊆ R+(G) ∪ R0(G) such that S has a majority of negative
outgoing edges, is similar.) Again, take the min-cut C de-
ﬁned by the above Lemma. Consider the cut C(cid:3)
which is
the same as C but where we have also cut all negative and
neutral edges from S and haven’t cut any positive edges. As
in the previous argument, this remains a cut and is smaller
than C, giving us the desired contradiction.

−(G)∪R(cid:3)

−(G)∪ R(cid:3)

(G) satisfy the groupthink axiom.

It remains to show that the min-cut system is the unique
system implied by the groupthink axiom. Suppose not. Sup-
pose that on some undirected graph, diﬀerent recommenda-
tions R(cid:3)
0(G))∩R+(G) is nonempty.
Case 1: The set S = (R(cid:3)
Since we have shown that the min-cut system satisﬁes group-
think and S ⊆ R+(G), this means that a strict majority of
edges between S and N \ S are between a node in S and
a node in V+ ∪ (R+(G) \ S). However, by deﬁnition of S,
(R+(G)\ S)∩ (R(cid:3)
0(G)) is the empty set, or in other
words R+(G) \ S ⊆ R(cid:3)
+(G) since every nonvoter has either
a −, 0, or + recommendation in R(cid:3)
. This gives us the de-
sired contradiction because we have more than half of the
+(G) ∪ V+, which
edges leaving S pointing to nodes in R(cid:3)
contradicts Groupthink (a).
0(G)) ∩ R−(G) (cid:9)= ∅. This
+(G) ∪ R(cid:3)
Case 2: The set (R(cid:3)
follows from the previous case by symmetry.
0(G)) ∩ R+(G) = (R(cid:3)
−(G) ∪ R(cid:3)
+(G) ∪
Case 3: The sets (R(cid:3)
0(G)) ∩ R−(G) = ∅, but T = R(cid:3)
+(G) ∩ R0(G) (cid:9)= ∅. Again,
R(cid:3)
because the min-cut system satisﬁes groupthink, the set T
which is unanimously 0 under R cannot have a strict major-
ity of its edges pointing to nodes in (R+(G)∪ V+)\ T . How-
ever, it is unanimously positive under R(cid:3)
, so it must have a
+(G)∪V+)\T .
strict majority of edges pointing to nodes in (R(cid:3)
However, by our choice of T , these two sets are equal.
+(G) ∪
0(G)) ∩ R+(G) = (R(cid:3)
Case 4: The sets (R(cid:3)
0(G)) ∩ R−(G) = ∅, but R(cid:3)
−(G) ∩ R0(G) (cid:9)= ∅. This follows
R(cid:3)
from the previous case by symmetry.
The above four cases cover all possibilities in which R(cid:3) (cid:9)=

−(G) ∪ R(cid:3)

R.
