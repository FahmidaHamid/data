A. OPTIMAL RECRAWLING FOR

HOLISTIC STALENESS

We specialize our model of optimal recrawling from Sec-
tion 2.2 to the case where the divergence metric of interest
is holistic staleness.

Following the model of [4], suppose each page P expe-
riences updates according to a Poisson process with rate
parameter λP , where each update is substantial enough to
cause the crawled version to become stale. Consider a par-
ticular page P that was most recently refreshed at time 0.
The probability that P has undergone at least one update
during the interval [0, t] is 1 − e−λP ·t. Hence the expected
P (t) = 1 − e−λP ·t. The
divergence D(P, P (cid:48)) is given by D∗
expected utility of refreshing P at time t, according to Equa-
«
tion 4, is found to be:

„

UP (t) =

−

1
λP

t +

λP

−λP ·t
e

The policy of refreshing a page whenever UP (t) ≥ T (for
some constant T ) results in identical schedules to those re-
sulting from the optimal policy derived in [4] for the same
holistic staleness objective.

B.

INTERPOLATION OF DIVERGENCE

Our interpolation method starts by assigning to each page
an eagerness score, based on whether the divergence curve
tends to be concave (high eagerness) or convex (low eager-
ness). A page with a high eagerness score contains dynamic
content that has rapid turnover, such as advertisements.

Given three consecutive snapshots P (t0), P (t1) and P (t2)

of a page P , eagerness is measured as:

E(P, t0) =

D(P (t0), P (t1))
D(P (t0), P (t2))

The overall eagerness score E(P ) ∈ [0, 1] is found by aver-
aging over all (t0, t1, t2) triples for which all three snapshots
were downloaded successfully.

Now, suppose we have two consecutive snapshots P (tx)
and P (tx+1) and wish to estimate divergence inside the in-
terval (P (tx), P (tx+1)), relative to some base version P (tB).
We do so by taking the average of the two endpoint diver-
gence values, weighted by eagerness. Mathematically, for
any t ∈ (tx, tx+1) we assume D(P (tB), P (t)) = (1 − E(P )) ·
D(P (tB), P (tx)) + E(P ) · D(P (tB), P (tx+1)).
