Hence, the ontology search engine can use the f-DL-Lite
query engine to query across all the meta-ontologies in its
repository, so as to support keyword-plus-entailment searches.
Further discussions of this use case go beyond the scope of
this paper.

6. DISCUSSIONS

How to apply Description Logic based ontologies in the
Web has been a pressing issue for the Semantic Web com-
munity [14]. Web applications require ontology engines to
be able to handle fuzzy and imprecise data in an eﬃcient
and scalable manner, which has been a big challenge for
existing fuzzy ontology engines.
In this paper, we tackle
this issue by providing eﬃcient and scalable query services
for lightweight fuzzy ontologies (in f-DL-Lite), based on the
the two novel query languages we proposed for fuzzy on-
tologies. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
ﬁrst to report on implementations and evaluations of scal-
able and expressive conjunctive query answering over fuzzy
ontologies. Our online use case application shows that the
f-DL-Lite query engine can be used to enable keyword-plus-
entailment searches.

Our proposed query languages are related with weighted
Boolean queries [33, 4, 21] proposed in the ﬁeld fuzzy infor-
mation retrieval [8]. On the one hand, motivated by these
extensions we propose a completely novel query language,
that of threshold queries, which is very important since it
generalises the entailment of fuzzy assertions. On the other
hand, the main strength of the proposed general fuzzy query
language is its openness of the use of semantics generalising
most previous approaches, like those based on fuzzy implica-
tions [4], aggregation functions [21, 6, 32], Straccia’s query
language [29] for fuzzy DL-Lite and weighted t-norm queries
[7]. With the general fuzzy query language, we could provide
top-k query answering service over f-DL-Lite ontologies, sim-
ilar to that proposed by Straccia [30] for a variant of DL-Lite
ontologies. In short, the openness of the use of fuzzy seman-
tics and the generality of the presented algorithms make the
fuzzy querying service more adaptable for diﬀerent applica-
tion needs.

One aspect of our future work is to investigate scalable
querying services for more expressive fuzzy ontology lan-
guages, such as Fuzzy OWL [26]. Another part of our fu-
ture work should also consist of a survey on which query
language/semantics could/should be used in what scenarios
in Web applications.

This appendix contains a detailed presentation of the ab-
stract syntax of fuzzy-DL-Lite. Firstly, we present the ab-
stract syntax of crisp DL-Lite by restricting the elements of
the OWL DL syntax. Then, we provide the deﬁnition of in-
dividual axioms in fuzzy-DL-Lite which additionally contain
a membership degree and an inequality type.
