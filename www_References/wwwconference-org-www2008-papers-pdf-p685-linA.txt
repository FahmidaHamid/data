APPENDIX
Proof for Theorem 1

Proof. Given that Xt ∈ Rn×m

, each column of which
sums up to one, and Λt is an m-by-m diagonal matrix and
sum to one, we have

+

P (Ut|Ut−1) = P (Yt|Ut−1),

where Yt = XtΛt. Because of the constraint, for any given
Yt, there is a unique pair of Xt and Λt such that Yt = XtΛt,
and Xt and Λt satisfy the constraint. Thus, Yt uniquely
determines Ut, which implies

P (Ut|Ut−1) = P (Yt|Ut−1).

The logarithm of MAP is

L(Ut) = log P (Wt|Ut)P (Ut|Ut−1)

= log P (Wt|Ut)P (XtΛt|Ut−1)
= log multinom(vec (Wt) ; θt)

+ log Dirichlet(vec (XtΛt) ; φt)

Since Pij θt;ij =Pk Λt;kk = 1 and Pik Yt;ik =Pk Λt;kk =

1, we can further derive

L(Ut) = − D(Wtkθt;ij) − νD(Yt−1kYt) + const.

+ (1 − α)D(Yt−1kXtΛt)] + const.

Thus, maximizing L(Ut) is equivalent to minimizing the cost
function in Eq. (2).

Proof for Theorem 3

Proof. In the standard Q formula Eq. (6), the ﬁrst term
is the empirical probability that a randomly se-
lected edge has both ends in community k. For our case,

A(Vk ,Vk )
A(V,V )

this empirical probability should be Pi,j wij P (k|i)P (k|j).

For the second term in Eq. (6), A(Vk ,V )
is the empirical
A(V,V )
probability that a randomly selected edge is related to (i.e.,
has at least one end in) community k. For our case, this

empirical probability should be Pi P (k|i)Pj wij . By sum-

ming these two terms over all k’s and noticing that P (k|i) =
(D−1XΛ)ik, we get formula Eq. (7). In addition, it is straight-
forward to verify that Qs is equal to Q when D−1XΛ be-
comes a 0/1 indicator matrix.
