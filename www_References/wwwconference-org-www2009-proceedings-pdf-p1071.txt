Discounted cumulative gain (DCG). This metric is
widely used by major search engines to measure the per-
ceived relevance of ranked search results. For n queries q,
each with k ranked results, DCG [4] is deﬁned as

rank r.

Rank aggregation. During the course of play, multiple
rankings are produced which can be merged into a single
ranking using rank aggregation methods. Many diﬀerent
methods to determine an aggregate ranking exist [2], where
the optimal method depends on the application area. We
use the Kemeny rule, which is recognized as one of the best
overall [2].

The Kemeny rule minimizes the total number of disagree-
ments between the aggregate ranking and the input rank-
ings. Although determining the Kemeny ranking is NP-
hard [2], it can be solved optimally for a small number of
elements by using the following integer linear program (ILP):

minimize C(x) =P

a6=b nbaxab

subject to
xab + xba = 1 (∀a, b : a 6= b)
xab + xbc + xca ≤ 2 (∀a, b, c : a 6= b, b 6= c, c 6= a)
xab ∈ {0, 1} (∀a, b : a 6= b)

(2)

where for two elements a and b, xab = 1 if a is ranked ahead
of b in the aggregate ranking and 0 otherwise, and nba is the
number of input rankings that rank b ahead of a.

C1(x) = P
(3) C3(x) =P

a6=b mbaxab, (2) C2(x) = P

Game cost functions. We apply the ILP in Eq. 2 to
Thumbs-Up results using three diﬀerent cost functions: (1)
a6=b mbagbaxab, and
a6=b(αmba + (1 − α)mba)xab (where α ≤ 0.3
produced the same DCG as one by C2). Here gba is the
change in the gain for ranking b ahead of a (from Eq. 1),
and mba is computed as follows.

For the ranking of a and b, let Aba and Dba denote the
number of pairwise agreements and pairwise disagreements
if b is ranked ahead of a. We then set mba and mab to
Aba(1 + f ) and Aab(1 + f ) where f = (Dab + Dba)/(Aab +
Aba), which helps distribute disagreements to each side of
agreements proportional to their magnitudes. If there are
no agreements, we set f = 0.5, i.e., equal distribution.
