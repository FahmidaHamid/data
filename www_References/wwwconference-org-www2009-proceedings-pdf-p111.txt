Figure 7: An embedding of 100 users and 500 movies
into a 2-dimensional trait space (for a run with K =
2). The mean of the ﬁrst user trait (u(0)i) is plotted
against the mean of the second user trait (u(1)j ) to
produce the red dots. The mean of the ﬁrst movie
trait (v(0)i) is plotted against the mean of the second
movie trait (v(1)j ) to produce the blue dots. Some
movie titles are labeled. The triangle suggests the
region within which user 2114400 (the dot in the
bottom left) would like movies because similarity
between users and moves is measured by the inner
product. Note how the learned embedding separates
drama movies (top-right corner) as much as possible
from action movies (bottom-left corner).

Figure 8: An embedding of 190 query words and 339
advert title words into a 2-dimensional trait space
(for a run with K = 2). The mean of the ﬁrst query
word trait (u(0)i) is plotted against the mean of the
second query word trait (u(1)j ) to produce the red
dots. The mean of the ﬁrst advert word trait (v(0)i) is
plotted against the mean of the second advert word
trait (v(1)j ) to produce the blue dots. Some words
are labeled.
