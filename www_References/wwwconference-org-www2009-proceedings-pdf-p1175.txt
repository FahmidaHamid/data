between the neighbors of a node. If the neighborhood is fully con-
nected, the value is 1 and a value close to 0 means that there are
hardly any connections in the neighborhood.

The distribution of clustering coefﬁcient versus nodes number is
plotted in Figure 1(d), from which we can conclude that the distri-
bution ﬁts power law distribution and the mobile social network is
sparse as a whole but very dense in some local region.

3.4 Betweenness Centrality

Betweenness is the most widely used metric to measure the im-
portant of a node in a network. Vertices that occur on many shortest
paths between other vertices have higher betweenness.
