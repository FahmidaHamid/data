Figure 7: Performance evaluation per topic compar-
ison. The plots show the performance of reciprocal
election on the x-axis for each clustering compari-
son, with respect to the performance of the folding
and maxmin on the y-axis. For every topic above
the line, reciprocal election outperforms the corre-
sponding other method.

and require no training nor parameter tuning. Given a user
query, they adapt automatically to the set of image search
results. The weights for visual features in a dynamic rank-
ing function are computed on the ﬂy to emphasize highly
discriminant features for this set of results, and the number
of clusters is adaptive as well.

The folding strategy respects the ranking order and picks
the cluster representatives accordingly, while Reciprocal elec-
tion aims to optimize the clustering and the (s)election of
cluster representatives by a voting strategy where each im-
age determines a list of candidate images that it would best
represented by. After performing a large user-study to estab-
lish a ground truth and a baseline, we measure performance
of all methods.

Folding shows a better performance according to the Folw-
kes-Mallows index, a performance measure that focuses on
image pairs that can be formed with images from the same
cluster. This indicates that the folding approach beneﬁts
from its strong mechanism to automatically and dynami-
cally select a proper number of clusters. On the other hand,
reciprocal election signiﬁcantly outperforms the other meth-
ods in terms of variation of information, a more general per-
formance measure. The selection of candidates and the de-
cision on cluster membership both follow an intuitive notion
behind a clustering. We conjecture that this is rewarded by
means of a low variation of information, and therefore con-
clude that reciprocal election achieves the strongest overall
performance.

As part of our future work, we plan to do an in depth
evaluation of the feature weighting in the dynamic ranking
