Figure 4: [Best viewed in color] The positional vari-
ation in the diversity (a) and relevance (b) of the
product result set averaged over 100 queries with
n = 30, k = 10, λ = 1.0 and θ = 0.5.

where I (·) is the indicator function and lca(·,·) returns the
least common ancestor of the two given nodes. Figure 4(a)
illustrates the positional variation in the novelty of both the
product search results ranked by popularity and the diverse
set of results produced by MAXMINDISPERSION. For the
relevance evaluation, we did not have any ground truth to
compare the diﬀerent orderings.
Instead, we posit that a
result is relevant to the query depending on how related the
result and the query categories are in the taxonomy. We
consider two categories to be completely related if one sub-
sumes the other. Given a query q, we compute the relevance
of a list L as

8. APPENDIX
8.1 Impossibility Result

Proof of Theorem 1. We start by ﬁxing functions w(·)
and d(·,·) such that f is maximized by a unique S∗
k for all
k ≥ 2. Such a set of functions always exist, from the richness
axiom. Now, ﬁxing a k, we can use the uniqueness property
and the stability axiom, to say that ∀y /∈ S∗

k+1, we have:

∗
k+1) > f (S

k ∪ {y})
∗

f (S

k+1 \ S∗

k ∪ {y}) ≥ f (S∗

Note that we have a strict inequality here, as otherwise the
monotonicity axiom would imply that there is no unique
k) for all y /∈ S∗
k+1, as we have that f (S∗
S∗
k.
From here on, we ﬁx one such y.
Let x = S∗
k (which follows from stability). Now,
we invoke the strength of relevance (b) axiom for S∗
k, in
conjunction with the independence of irrelevant attributes
axiom, to imply that the function value f (S∗
k+1) of the set
k+1 decreases by some δ > 0 if w(u) is ﬁxed for all u ∈ S
S∗
and w(x) = a0 for some a0 > 0. Next, we do the following
transformation: 1) increase d(y, u) for all u ∈ S∗
k to be equal
to twice their current value, and 2) scale all the relevance
and distance values by half.

k and S∗

Firstly, note that the ﬁrst step of this transformation is
consistent (in the sense deﬁned in the consistency axiom)
w.r.t both S∗
k+1. Also, the second step uses global
scaling, and hence from the scale invariance and consistency
axioms, we have that the output of f for size k and k + 1
should still be S∗
k+1 respectively. Further, from the
above comment about the decrease in f (S∗
k+1), we have that
k+1) − f (S∗
f (S∗
k) strictly decreases. In addition, we can use
k ∪ {y})
the strength of diversity (a) axiom to see that f (S∗
strictly increases. Repeating this process several times, we
are guaranteed to get a state where
