Putting this all together, we get

P r [x occurs in the next step | Xk] =

dX

i=1

pi · B(pi, h, k)
dX

B(pj , h, k)

j=1

Thus, if we have observed that an item x has occurred k times
in h steps, and knowing d and z but not taking into account any
observations about how many times other items have occurred in these
h steps, the above estimates the likelihood the item will occur again
in the next step, or in any other step.
