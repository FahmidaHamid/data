In summary, our experimental results show that CQA-
MR is an eﬀective method for identifying high quality con-
tent and highly-reputable users in CQA, particularly when
training data is limited. More importantly, we have shown
that the predicted quality and reputation features, when
modeled explicitly, signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of CQA
retrieval. Finally, our experiments show the eﬀectiveness of
our mutual reinforcement algorithm, as GBRank-MR sig-
niﬁcantly outperforms a state-of-the-art supervised method
(GBRank-Supervised, implemented using SVM) operat-
ing on the same features.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We presented CQA-MR, a framework for semi-supervised
quality and reputation estimation of content and users in
Community Question Answering. We have demonstrated
the eﬀectiveness of CQA-MR in large-scale experiments of
a CQA dataset comprising over 100,000 users, 27,000 ques-
tions, and more than 200,000 answers. Our experiments
demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements over the supervised
method, both in accuracy and in reducing the required amount
of training data.
Interestingly, for the task of predicting
question quality, CQA-MR signiﬁcantly outperforms a su-
pervised method while requiring no question quality train-
ing labels. Furthermore, we demonstrated a signiﬁcant im-
provement that CQA-MR provides for the practical task of
